## Medical Practitioners
   
   **Verifiable/Issuing Association - IMA(Kochi Chapter)**

   Nobody can take risks when it comes to health. So, when someone is suffering from a health related issue, he/she will, most probably, consult an experienced and well renowned doctor. We usually ask our friends/relatives for recommendations on a good doctor or visit the highly rated hospital. Sometimes we even consult more than one doctor to get a second opinion regarding one's health issue. This practise can be time consuming and can be tiring as well. There are situations were the treatment should be given on time and in such a situation, this practise should not be followed.

   With KochiOrgBook, doctors will be issued a digital identity about who they are and what their qualification is and a normal citizen can access these informations from their fingertips. With this, an individual can make the best decisions on time and with ease.

   It is quite difficult to identity lawyers who are specialized in specific types of cases from public information as only their name and qualifications are made available.

   Anyone who needs to take up the driving license test should first prove their eligibility, mainly age. Other than age, one should give proof for their identity and address.
