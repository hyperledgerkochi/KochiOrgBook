In the current form it may not be feasible for an ordinary citizen to confirm if these association are valid or not due to chance of forgery of documents and we often trust the documents they present making it quite easy to misguide anyone.

With KochiOrgBook, each citizen can easily verify the authenticity of an Association registered with KOB through a [Search Service](gf_info/sub_projects.md#kobsearch).

Another bottleneck is that, for a citizen to avail any service or to prove their eligibility or identity, they have to provide a number of documents. Often the whole process takes time and a lot of effort.

This utility aims to cut down the red tape and improve the overall efficiency of the current processes.


## Mission

Internet scale digital trust with close to 1 million digital credentials on the network.​
