<p>WHEREAS, subject to the Transaction Author complying with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the KOB Consortia grants permission to the Transaction Author to write Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks;  </p>
<p>FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, THE SUFFICIENCY OF WHICH IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS: </p>
<h2 id="1-definitions"><strong>1) Definitions</strong></h2>

<h2 id="2permission-to-write-to-the-kobpiu-ledger-networks"><strong>2)Permission to Write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks  </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The KOB Consortia hereby grants to Transaction Author a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty free, revocable license to write to and use the KOBPIU Ledger Networks in accordance with this Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When authoring Transactions under the policy of Permissioned Write Access, a Transaction Author may only write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by using an authorized Transaction Endorser. In the event that KOB Consortia enables Public Write Access to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks, the Transaction Author will not need a Transaction Endorser to endorse a Transaction.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an initial Transaction has been written to one of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by the Transaction Author (“Initial Transaction”), the Transaction Author is granted permission to make additional Transactions to update the state of a previous Transaction (“Update Transactions”). Please note, an Update Transaction does not remove the Initial Transaction, which will remain on the KOBPIU Ledger due to its immutability and may remain on KOBPIU Test Networks unless they are reset. Transaction Author may make Update Transactions if and only if the Transaction Author was the author of the Initial Transaction. Update Transactions are Transactions and are subject to all the terms of this Agreement.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-transaction-author-obligations"><strong>3) Transaction Author Obligations</strong></h2>
<ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>comply with any requirements imposed by the Transaction Endorser on the Transaction Author and any Transactions endorsed by the Transaction Endorser;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not write Transactions containing Personal Data until KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transactions to contain Personal Data pursuant to Section 3(b) below.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transaction Authors to write Transactions that contain Permissible Personal Data (“Personal Data Transactions”), then Transaction Author expressly agrees that:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It will not write any Transactions that contain Impermissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is an independent data controller (as defined in the GDPR) of the Personal Data Transactions and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the Data Protection Laws; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it acknowledges and will notify all data subjects whose Personal Data it Processes that functions inherent in blockchain technology may render fulfilling data subject requests difficult or impossible. For example, due to blockchain’s immutability, data stored on a blockchain generally cannot be removed or altered once the data is confirmed on the blockchain;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it irrevocably waives any and all claims, rights and/or obligations it may have now or in the future against the KOB Consortia as a result of being unable to fulfill data subject requests in accordance with Data Protection Laws;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to Transaction Author as a controller of Personal Data Transactions under the Data Processing Agreements with Stewards and Transaction Endorsers, each in their roles as processors under the GDPR, and attached as Appendices A and B (the “DPAs”);  </p>

<li>
<p>that the KOB Consortia has the right to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and the DPAs are made a part of the Agreement in their entirety;  </p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>at the KOB Consortia’s request, the Transaction Author will reimburse the KOB Consortia for any costs incurred by the KOB Consortia in enforcing the Transaction Author’s rights under the GDPR, including but not limited to fulfillment of data subject rights, rights of oversight and audit, etc.; and  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it irrevocably waives any and all claims that it may have now or in the future that the KOB Consortia lacks the rights to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and bind Transaction Author to the DPAs’ terms and conditions, including the limitation of liability therein. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-term-and-termination"><strong>4) Term and Termination </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in force until terminated by either Party pursuant to this Section 4 (Term and Termination).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (i) if the other Party has materially defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement and has not cured such default within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of written notice from the non-defaulting Party of such default or (ii) immediately in the event of any government sanctions or other legal measures that make it unlawful for Transaction Author to write Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks.  </p>

<h2 id="7-governing-law-and-forum"><strong>7) Governing Law and Forum</strong></h2>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles; provided that, if Transaction Author is a governmental entity, this Agreement is governed by the law in which such governmental entity is established. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “Rules”) by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules. Arbitration proceedings will be held in London, England. Unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree, such arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by electronic exchange of documents and by video conference. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator shall require exchange by the Parties of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim, defense, or counterclaim or on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim, defense, or counterclaim, with due regard for eliminating undue burden and expense and the expedited and lower cost nature of arbitration. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator may at his or her discretion order the deposition of witnesses. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three depositions per Party, each of a maximum of four hours duration, unless the arbitrator otherwise determines. Demand for arbitration may be initiated by either Party on fifteen (15) days written notice by email to the other Party’s designated representative, together with a written specification of the grounds for the dispute and the relief requested. By agreeing to binding and non-appealable arbitration, each party understands that they each forever give up and waive any right which each Party may have to resolve any such claim, difference or dispute by court or jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring a proceeding seeking equitable or injunctive relief solely and exclusively in the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, to prevent the infringement of intellectual property rights or the disclosure of confidential information. Each Party hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication of any such equitable or injunctive relief, as well as for any such matters that are excluded from or fall outside of this arbitration provision. </p>
