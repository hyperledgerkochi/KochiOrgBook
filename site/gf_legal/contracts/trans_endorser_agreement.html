<p>This Agreement is governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles; provided that, if Transaction Endorser is a governmental entity, this Agreement is governed by the law in which such governmental entity is established. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “Rules”) by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules. Arbitration proceedings will be held in London, England. Unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree, such arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by electronic exchange of documents and by video conference. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator shall require exchange by the Parties of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim, defense, or counterclaim or on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim, defense, or counterclaim, with due regard for eliminating undue burden and expense and the expedited and lower cost nature of arbitration. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator may at his or her discretion order the deposition of witnesses. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three depositions per Party, each of a maximum of four hours duration, unless the arbitrator otherwise determines. Demand for arbitration may be initiated by either Party on fifteen (15) days written notice by email to the other Party’s designated representative, together with a written specification of the grounds for the dispute and the relief requested. By agreeing to binding and non-appealable arbitration, each Party understands that they each forever give up and waive any right which each Party may have to resolve any such claim, difference or dispute by court or jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring a proceeding seeking equitable or injunctive relief solely and exclusively in the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, to prevent the infringement of intellectual property rights or the disclosure of confidential information. Each Party hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication of any such equitable or injunctive relief, as well as for any such matters that are excluded from or fall outside of this arbitration provision. </p>
