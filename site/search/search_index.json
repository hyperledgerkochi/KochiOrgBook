KOB includes a Decentralised Identity(DID) based Public Identity Utiltity(KOBPIU) network, a Verifiable Organisations Network(KOBVON) for the associations in Kochi, an Association Wallet(KOBAW) , a DID based Mobile Wallet application(KOBConnect) and a Community Cloud(KOBCC) . KOB is a technology demonstrator to launch a DID based public identity utility compliant with the ToIP standards to enable Trusted digital verification service for various association within the city of Kochi.\u200b Our Objective The objective of this initiative is to create a Digital Trust Ecosystem for the citizens, associations and digital service providers in the city of Kochi by setting up a KOB Consortia and enabling any Association, having it's presence in the city of Kochi, to register on the KOBVON network to issue digital proofs and host a Verifiable Credential Registry(VCR) in a transparent and cost efficient manner. Our Key Service Offerings Enabling citizens of Kochi as open source contributors Provide a platform for associations in Kochi to avail/host digital services Enable Digital services providers to build and host their digital services on KOB There are three main stakeholders for KochiOrgBook - Citizens of Kochi , Associations in Kochi and Digital Service Providers . The motivators for these stakeholders are, Stakeholders Motivators Citizens - Ownership of one's digital identity - Privacy - Trusted digital services offering. Associations - Ownership of one's digital identity - Privacy - Trusted digital services offering. - Enhance confidency and trust on digital service providers. - Dedicated community cloud for availing shared infra. - Low expense in hosting a node for associations who doesn't have the necessary infra. Digital Service Providers - Trusted digital services offering. - Incentivized service offerings Citizen Developers - Earn incentives through contributions - Opportunity to get a first-hand experience. In the current form it may not be feasible for an ordinary citizen to confirm if these association are valid or not due to chance of forgery of documents and we often trust the documents they present making it quite easy to misguide anyone. With KochiOrgBook, each citizen can easily verify the authenticity of an Association registered with KOB through a Search Service . Another bottleneck is that, for a citizen to avail any service or to prove their eligibility or identity, they have to provide a number of documents. Often the whole process takes time and a lot of effort. This utility aims to cut down the red tape and improve the overall efficiency of the current processes. Mission Internet scale digital trust with close to 1 million digital credentials on the network.\u200b","title":"Home"},{"location":"home.html#our-objective","text":"The objective of this initiative is to create a Digital Trust Ecosystem for the citizens, associations and digital service providers in the city of Kochi by setting up a KOB Consortia and enabling any Association, having it's presence in the city of Kochi, to register on the KOBVON network to issue digital proofs and host a Verifiable Credential Registry(VCR) in a transparent and cost efficient manner.","title":"Our Objective"},{"location":"home.html#our-key-service-offerings","text":"","title":"Our Key Service Offerings"},{"location":"home.html#enabling-citizens-of-kochi-as-open-source-contributors","text":"","title":"Enabling citizens of Kochi as open source contributors"},{"location":"home.html#provide-a-platform-for-associations-in-kochi-to-availhost-digital-services","text":"","title":"Provide a platform for associations in Kochi to avail/host digital services"},{"location":"home.html#enable-digital-services-providers-to-build-and-host-their-digital-services-on-kob","text":"There are three main stakeholders for KochiOrgBook - Citizens of Kochi , Associations in Kochi and Digital Service Providers .

The mission of the ToIP foundation is to simplify and standardize how trust is established online so that everyone can feel safe, secure, and private in all of our digital interactions \u2014 whether between individuals, businesses, governments, or any \u201cthing\u201d on the Internet of Things. DID \u2013 Decentralized Identifier DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. Each DID has associated with it one or more public keys created by the DID owner (and the owner holds the corresponding private keys), and one or more endpoints - addresses where messages can be delivered for that identity. A DID can be uniquely resolved (like a URL) to return the the data (public keys and endpoints) associated with the DID. Agents and Wallets It is hard to manage all the DIDs a person creates or receives. Indy uses the term \"Agent\" to mean the software that interacts with other entities, and the term \"Wallet\" as a data store for the DIDs and related information. For example, a person might have a mobile Agent app on their smart devices, while an Organization might have an enterprise Agent running on a Cloud Server. All Agents have a secure Wallet for storing identity data. A personal Agent wallet is similar to a password manager - there is a name for each relationship and associated data. However, unlike Password Managers that use things like your copy/paste clipboard for User IDs and Passwords and \"screen-scrape\" applications and websites, Agents communicate directly with Agents to accomplish Identity-related tasks. The picture below is an example of some communicating Indy Agents. The Edge Agents are handled by the Identity owners themselves - in this case a Consumer and an Enterprise. The Cloud Agents facilitate the messaging by, for example, providing a permanent endpoint for a device that may or may not be online at the time messages are being received. Credential Credentials are things like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees that are given to us from an issuing authority that we can use to show to others when needed. Verifiable Credential(VC) VCs are digital equivalents of paper credentials that are cryptographically processed such that when we show (\"prove\") the claims (data elements from the Credentials), the receiver (\"Verifier\") can be certain: - Who issued the claims - That the claims were issued to the Identity presenting them - That the claims have not been tampered with (forged), and - That the claims' Credential has not been revoked by the Issuer. As the image below shows, the data flow for Verifiable Credentials is the same as with paper documents - Issuers give Verifiable Credentials to the Holder, and the Holder can prove them to Verifiers at any time. Issuer, Holder, Verifier Issuer - Issues Verifiable Credentials to the Holder Holder - Holders request credentials from issuers, hold them in their wallets and present them when requested by verifiers Verifier - Verifies the claims presented by the Holder TIP \u2013 Trust over IP Interoperability Profile\u200b A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems. TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. TSWG \u2013 Technology Stack Working Group\u200b This working group (members) concerns a broadly defined and broadly applicable set of technologies (the \"stack of technology\") that can be used to promote the ability of project-level scientists to build web-based data and processing services that are readily found and used by others. Part of this effort is to promote interoperability between individual services in order to help scientists pursue more integrated science. GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation\u200b General Data Protection Regulation is meant to fundamentally reshape how personal data are collected and processed by giving all individuals living in the European Union (or the greater European Economic Area) new rights to access and control their data on the Internet. Identity Utility Network An Identity Utility Network associated with a DID Root Namespace that operates under its own Governance Framework. Digital Trust Ecosystem An interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that share a standardized trust model for mutually beneficial purposes, such as consumer and commercial interactions that are verifiable. DID Namespace Building on URI Standards, the DID Specification allows for both root namespace (did:xxx) and sub-namespace (did:xxx:yyy) conventions. Node A computer network server running an instance of the code necessary to operate a distributed ledger or blockchain. Browser wars A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation of browser war began, this time adding extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected. Credential Registry The Credential Registry is a cloud-based library that collects, maintains, and connects information on all types of credentials Digital Service Providers DSPs are providers of DID based solutions. Citizen Developers Citizens of Kochi who are willing to make contributions to the project, such as hosting a node, resolving issues, contributing code etc.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"gf_controlled/glossary.html#toip-trust-over-ip-foundation","text":"It comes under the Linux Foundation.

A few of the key use cases are listed below. Medical Practitioners Verifiable/Issuing Association - IMA(Kochi Chapter) Nobody can take risks when it comes to health. So, when someone is suffering from a health related issue, he/she will, most probably, consult an experienced and well renowned doctor. We usually ask our friends/relatives for recommendations on a good doctor or visit the highly rated hospital. Sometimes we even consult more than one doctor to get a second opinion regarding one's health issue. This practise can be time consuming and can be tiring as well. There are situations were the treatment should be given on time and in such a situation, this practise should not be followed. With KochiOrgBook, doctors will be issued a digital identity about who they are and what their qualification is and a normal citizen can access these informations from their fingertips. With this, an individual can make the best decisions on time and with ease. Use case diagram Lawyers Verifiable/Issuing Association - Bar Council of India(Kochi High Court Chapter) It is quite difficult to identity lawyers who are specialized in specific types of cases from public information as only their name and qualifications are made available. All lawyers may not be able to offer legal consultation services which makes it difficult for a citizen to approach the right lawyer without connections. This could take time and may impact the ability of an individual to contest legal claims at court efficiently. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen of the city of Kochi to verify that the Lawyer is qualified to handle or offer legal consultation on specific types of cases in a most efficient and trustworthy manner. Driving License\u200b Verifiable/Issuing Association - Regional Transport Office(Kochi) Anyone who needs to take up the driving license test should first prove their eligibility, mainly age. Other than age, one should give proof for their identity and address. Then the RTO department goes through the presented documents and declare one eligible, if they approve of it. This entire process can take up a lot of time and individuals will have to provide a number of documents to prove their eligibility and identity. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen to present digital proofs to take up driving license test leveraging capabilities of verifiable credentials and increase efficiency of the process. Verification services to provide specific digital identities Services - Email verification service, Phone number verification service, Address verification service Today, email-id and phone number are the most shared information throughout the internet. A person use their email-id/phone number to avail various services or share information or login to a particular website. But, even these credentials are misused for various illegal activities. This use case is focused on providing individual with basic verification services like Email verification service, Phone number verification service etc. With this each user can prove their ownership over their informations like email-id/phone number and they will be provided with a DID for these information which can be stored in a digital wallet app. Creating student credentials for applying admission to external Universities Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) Often a student will have to share multiple credential information for applying admission to external universities. The student would need to apply and secure many of these credentials from different source independently. Not every student may be well versed with the formalities involved this and this results in students incurring delays and cost for securing all the required credentials for applying to external Universities. Lack of transparency in the process also causes some students to miss out on the requesting credentials in specific format which forces them to miss out on apply for admissions. This use case is focused on enabling a student to collect all required digital credentials /proofs and submit them in a timely manner leveraging a workflow which offers transparency, enhance efficiency, and reduces cost to apply for admissions. University issued digital credential Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) In this use case, a student under a particular university will be issued a DID proving him/her a valid student under the university.

Version Control Version: 0.1 Governing Board Approval Date: TBD Comments: Ratification of the KOBPIU-GF will take place upon the formation of the Governing Board (at first meeting). Status: TBD Acknowledgements \u200bThis document was produced on behalf of the KOBPIU Governing Board by the KOBPIU Governance Framework Working Group. KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document 1. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the KOBPIU is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted commerce. The KOBPIU-GF works as the constitution for the KOBPIU. It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The KOBPIU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the KOBPIU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that consortium members may have as itility participants. The KOBPIU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents shown in blue and yellow in Figure(). The KOB Consortia will also publish additional operational documents, including white papers, FAQs, readiness checklists, design guidelines, sample schemas, etc., as needed. The documents are organized in three categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. The normative documents in the KOBPIU-GF V1 are: KOBPOIU Governance Framework Master Document V1 - The present document. Five legal agreements: KOBPIU Steward Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Stewards who operate Nodes of the KOBPIU. Transaction Author Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Identity Owners writing Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Transaction Endorser Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and Organizations using Permissioned Write Access. Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) V1 \u2014 The agreement under which Stewards serve as data processors from a data protection regulatory standpoint. Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement V1 \u2014 The DPA that applies to Transaction Endorsers. KOBPIU Glossary V1 \u2014 The terminology and definitions that apply to all KOBPIU-GF documents and across KOBPIU infrastructure as a whole. Controlled Documents \u2014 Technical specifications, standards, and policies that are independently maintained and versioned either by the KOB Consortia (e.g., the KOBPIU (TODO:-Change back) DID Method) or external standards bodies (e.g., W3C, OASIS). Another document, the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework , does not directly govern KOBPIU Infrastructure; rather it defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of KOBPIU actors, including the KOB Consortia, to the policies of the KOBPIU-GF. 2. CORE PRINCIPLES The following principles guide the development of policies in the KOBPIU-GF 2.1 Self-Sovereignty Individuals are endowed with and possess an inalienable right to be Identity Owners with the ability to permanently control one or more Self-Sovereign Identities without reliance on any external administrative authority. An Identity Owner alone shall determine which Identity Data describe its Identities. With regard to managing its own Identity Data, an Identity Owner alone shall determine how and for what purpose(s) it is processed. An Identity Owner alone shall determine who has access to its Identity Data. An Identity Owner\u2019s Identity Data shall be portable as determined by the Identity Owner and enabled via Open Standards. An Identity Owner alone shall have the right to Delegate control of these functions. 2.2 Guardianship An Individual who does not have the capability to directly control that Individual\u2019s Identity Data (a Dependent) shall have the right to appoint another Identity Owner who has that capability (an Independent or an Organization) to serve as the owner\u2019s Guardian. If a Dependent does not have the capability to directly appoint a Guardian, the Dependent shall still have the right to have a Guardian appointed to act on the Dependent\u2019s behalf. A Dependent has the right tobecome an Independent by claiming full control of the Dependent\u2019s Identity Data. A Guardian has the obligation to promptly assist in this process provided the Dependent can demonstrate that the Dependent has the necessary capabilities. Guardianship shall not be confused with Delegation or Impersonation. Guardianship under the KOBPIU Governance Framework should be mapped in the proper contexts to various legal constructs, including legal guardianship , power of attorney , conservatorship , living trusts , and so on. 2.3 Openness and Interoperability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall use Open Standards and avoid mechanisms that would prevent Identity Owners from having interoperability or portability of their Identity Data both within the KOBPIU Network and with other networks and systems. 2.4 Accountability Identity Owners shall be accountable to each other for conformance to the purpose, principles, and policies of the KOBPIU Governance Framework. All KOBPIU Entities shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with any other requirements of applicable law. Nothing in the KOBPIU Governance Framework shall require a KOBPIU Entity to breach applicable law in order for it to perform its obligations under the KOBPIU Governance Framework. 2.5 Sustainability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and operated to be technically, economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable for the long term. 2.6 Transparency The KOB Consortia shall practice Open Governance, and the KOB Consortia and the Stewards in their KOBPIU Ledger Roles shall operate with full openness and transparency to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the principles herein, including the proceedings of the KOBPIU Board of Trustees and all KOBPIU Governing Bodies, the development and distribution of KOBPIU Open Source Code, the qualification and operation of Stewards, and any revisions to the KOBPIU Governance Framework. 2.7 Collective Best Interest The KOB Consortia shall act in the collective best interests of all Identity Owners and shall not favor the interests of any single Identity Owner or group of Identity Owners over the interests of the KOB Consortia as a whole. Note that at present the KOBPIU Governance Framework has no self-enforcing distributed mechanism that neutralises differences of interest among different stakeholders participating in the network, therefore this is the responsibility of the KOB Consortia. Future versions of the KOBPIU Governance Framework shall aim to provide such mechanisms. 2.8 Decentralization by Design 2.8.1 General KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be decentralized to the greatest extent possible consistent with the other principles herein. As the business, legal, and technical limitations of decentralization may change over time, the KOB Consortia shall continuously examine all points of control, decision, and governance to seek ongoing conformance with this principle. 2.8.2 Diffuse Trust KOBPIU Infrastructure shall not concentrate power in any single Individual, Organization, Jurisdiction, Industry Sector, or other special interest to the detriment of the Network as a whole. Diffuse Trust shall take into account all forms of diversity among Identity Owners. 2.8.3 Web of Trust KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed to not favor any single root of trust, but empower any KOBPIU Entity to serve as a root of trust and enable all KOBPIU Entities to participate in any number of interwoven Trust Communities. 2.8.4 Censorship Resistance KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed to resist censorship of any Entity while remaining compliant with all applicable laws. 2.8.5 High Availability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented to maximize availability of the KOBPIU Network. 2.8.6 No Single Point of Failure KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented to not have any single point of failure . 2.8.7 Regenerative KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed so that failed components can be quickly and easily replaced by other components. 2.8.8 Distributive KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented such that authority is vested, functions performed, and resources used by the smallest or most local part of the KOB Consortia that includes all relevant and affected parties. Deliberations should be conducted and decisions made by bodies and methods that reasonably represent all relevant and affected parties and are dominated by none. 2.8.9 Innovation at the Edge The continued development of the KOBPIU Infrastructure shall encourage innovation to take place at the edges of the network among the members of the KOB Consortia most directly involved or impacted. 2.9 Inclusive by Design 2.9.1 General The design, governance, and operation of KOBPIU Infrastructure shall follow the principles of Inclusive Design to serve the widest possible community of Identity Owners. 2.9.2 Identity for All Consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 , the KOB Consortia and the KOBPIU Network shall promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; enable access to justice for all; and facilitate effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels by being accessible to, and inclusive of all Identity Owners without discrimination and with accommodation for physical, economic, or other limitations of Identity Owners to the greatest extent feasible. 2.9.3 People-Centered Design KOBPIU Developers shall put people at the heart of the design process and enable them to control their own user experience. 2.9.4 Design for Difference KOBPIU Developers shall strive to understand differences in capabilities and preferences across all potential members of the KOB Consortia and provide adaptable solutions to meet the needs of all potential members. 2.9.5 Test Across Contexts KOBPIU Developers shall test KOBPIU solutions for use in different Identity Owner environments and contexts. 2.9.6 Offer Choice KOBPIU Developers shall design flexibility by offering a choice of ways to achieve the same outcome. 2.9.7 Maintain Consistent Experience KOBPIU Developers shall design comparable experiences for all of their user communities that use consistent design elements and language. 2.10 Privacy by Design 2.10.1 General The design, governance, and operation of KOBPIU Infrastructure shall follow the Seven Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design to the greatest extent possible consistent with the other principles herein. These principles can be summarized as: Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial Privacy as the Default Setting Privacy Embedded into Design Full Functionality\u2014Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum End-to-End Security\u2014Full Lifecycle Protection Visibility and Transparency\u2014Keep it Open Respect for User Privacy\u2014Keep it User-Centric 2.10.2 Pairwise Pseudonyms by Default Agents using the KOBPIU Protocol shall default to assigning Pairwise Pseudonyms, Pairwise Public Keys, and, when necessary, Pairwise Service Endpoints whenever forming a Connection unless specifically directed otherwise by an Identity Owner. 2.10.3 Selective Disclosure by Default Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers using the KOBPIU Protocol shall default to issuing, holding, and accepting Credentials that support Zero-Knowledge Proofs and privacy-respecting Revocation Registries by default. 2.10.4 Governance Framework Disclosure by Default KOBPIU Entities shall by default disclose the Governance Framework under which a Connection is created, an Interaction is performed, or a Credential is exchanged. Agents shall by default notify their Identity Owner of any conflict between the Identity Owner\u2019s privacy preferences and the Governance Framework\u2019s privacy policies. 2.10.5 Owner Controlled Storage by Default Agents shall store Private Data in decentralized data storage controlled by the Identity Owner by default. 2.10.6 Anti-Correlation by Design and Default KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented to avoid correlation of an Identity Owner, or of a Thing associated with an Identity Owner, without the direct knowledge and informed consent of the Identity Owner. 2.10.7 Guardian and Delegate Confidentiality The use of a Guardian or Delegate may be confidential information and shall only be disclosed with the authorization of the Identity Owner and of the Guardian and/or Delegate. 2.11 Security by Design 2.11.1 General The design, governance, and operation of KOBPIU Infrastructure shall follow the principles of Security by Design to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the other principles herein. 2.11.2 System Diversity The process and policies for selecting Stewards shall optimize availability and security by maximizing diversity of hosting locations, environments, networks, and systems. 2.11.3 Secure Defaults The default configuration settings and user experience of the applications using KOBPIU Infrastructure shall enforce strong protection by default, including encryption by default. 2.11.4 Least Privilege Access and authorization of the applications, Agents, and network services that use and comprise KOBPIU Infrastructure shall subscribe to the concept of least privilege . 2.11.5 Anti-Impersonation Applications shall be designed to not knowingly allow any party other than the Identity Owner to act as (impersonate) the Identity Owner. Impersonation does not include Guardianship or Delegation. 2.11.6 Auditability Transactions in KOBPIU Infrastructure and actions of application using KOBPIU Infrastructure that require auditing shall be immutably logged, in a tamper-evident way, and be available to verify processing. 2.11.7 Secure Failure Applications using KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed to take an exception or error path that will not create a security weakness exploitable by bad actors. 2.11.8 Pervasive Mediation Applications using KOBPIU Infrastructure shall not assume authorization is transitive across time and/or space\u2014rather security mechanisms shall check every access to every object, and authorize each action on its own merits, just in time. 2.12 Data Protection by Design and Default 2.12.1 General KOBPIU Entities, in the processing of personal data, shall adhere to the following data protection principles to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the other principles herein. 2.12.2 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the Individual. 2.12.3 Purpose Limitation Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall not be considered incompatible with the original processing purposes. 2.12.4 Data Minimization Personal data must be relevant and limited to that which is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is being processed. 2.12.5 Accuracy Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that where personal data is inaccurate it is erased or rectified without delay. 2.12.6 Storage Limitation Personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of Individuals for no longer than the duration necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is being processed. 2.12.7 Integrity and Confidentiality Personal data must be processed in a manner that provides appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (i.e., information security) 3 CORE POLICIES 3.1 Stewardship In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design and Security by Design principles: Policies, practices, procedures, and algorithms governing participation of Stewards and operation of Nodes MUST follow all Core Principles. The KOB Consortia MUST publish the following Controlled Documents managed as specified by KOB Consortia : a. KOBPIU Steward Business Policies b. KOBPIU Steward Technical Policies. c. KOBPIU Ledger Access Policies. 3.2 Guardianship In keeping with the Guardianship principle, a Guardian SHOULD: Act in the Dependent person\u2019s best interest. Exercise good judgment and carefully manage responsibilities. Avoid commingling\u2014keep Dependent\u2019s property separate (e.g., separate DIDs, Public Keys, Wallets, Vaults, etc.). Keep detailed records of all actions taken on behalf of the Dependent. Not violate the Anti-Impersonation principle (section 2.11.5). Be subject to applicable legal structures regarding the granting and revocation of Guardianships. 3.3 Inclusion In keeping with the Inclusive by Design principles: Access to the KOBPIU Network MUST be open to all Individuals and Organizations on a comparable basis without intentional exclusion of specific persons or communities. Developers SHOULD design for different capabilities in different contexts considering: a. Digital Exclusion (e.g., access to connected devices) b. Physical or Cognitive Exclusion (e.g., disability or incapacity) c. Political & Social Status (e.g., stateless individuals; being a child or a woman) d. Financial Status (e.g., having no income) e. Literacy & Language (e.g., low literacy or not speaking local language) 3.4 Trust Assurance In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design principles: The KOB Consortia MUST specify policies, practices, and procedures for assessing conformance to the KOBPIU Governance Framework by publishing and maintaining the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework as a Controlled Document managed as specified by KOBPIU Governing Bodies. The KOBPIU Governance Framework MUST be designed to provide a foundation for Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks (DSGFs) based on the KOBPIU Web of TrustModel. As soon as feasible, the KOBPIU Foundation MUST publish a DSGF, the KOBPIU Web of Trust Governance Framework, whose purpose is to enable decentralized discovery,navigation, and verification of DSGFs. The KOBPIU Foundation MUST publish the KOBPIU Trust Mark Policies as a Controlled Document managed as specified by KOBPIU Governing Bodies. An Entity serving in one of the KOBPIU Infrastructure Roles who meets the requirements in the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework MAY use the appropriate KOBPIU Trust Mark as specified in KOBPIU Trust Mark Policies. 3.5 Economics In keeping with the Sustainability principle: The KOB Consortia MUST publish the KOB Economic Policies as a Controlled Document managed as specified by KOBPIU Governing Bodies in conjunction with KOB Foundation legal counsel. The KOB Consortia MUST manage Ledger Fees and any mechanism used for paying them to ensure economic viability and sustainability for KOBPIU Infrastructure in keeping with its charter as a non-profit public trust organization. The KOB Consortia MUST retain a qualified Auditor to publish an annual public audit of KOBPIU Foundation finances. Note: KOB Consortia or KOBPIU Foundation? 4 GOVERNANCE The KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document and the Controlled Documents listed in Appendix A shall be revised from time to time as KOBPIU Infrastructure grows and evolves. The policies in this section govern this process. 4.1 General The KOB Consortia MUST publish KOB Governance Bodies as a Controlled Document managed by the KOB Board of Trustees. KOB Governance Bodies MUST specify the KOB Governing Body for each Controlled Document. All KOBPIU Governance Framework documents, including Controlled Documents, MUST use keywords in policies as defined in IETF RFC 2119 . All KOBPIU Governance Framework documents MAY be revised to add non-normative content, such as references to appendices, white papers, or other explanatory materials, without triggering a formal revision review process as defined in this section 4. 4.2 Revisions to the KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document These policies apply to any normative revision to the present document, exclusive of Appendix A. Revisions to the KOBPIU-GF Master Document MUST respect the Purpose and Core Principles. The commencement of any revision process MUST be publicly announced by the KOB Foundation no later than the time of commencement.

The KOBPIU-GF works as the constitution for the KOBPIU. It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The KOBPIU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the KOBPIU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that consortium members may have as itility participants. The KOBPIU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents shown in blue and yellow in Figure(). The KOB Consortia will also publish additional operational documents, including white papers, FAQs, readiness checklists, design guidelines, sample schemas, etc., as needed. The documents are organized in three categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. The normative documents in the KOBPIU-GF V1 are: KOBPOIU Governance Framework Master Document V1 - The present document. Five legal agreements: KOBPIU Steward Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Stewards who operate Nodes of the KOBPIU. Transaction Author Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Identity Owners writing Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Transaction Endorser Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and Organizations using Permissioned Write Access. Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) V1 \u2014 The agreement under which Stewards serve as data processors from a data protection regulatory standpoint. Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement V1 \u2014 The DPA that applies to Transaction Endorsers. KOBPIU Glossary V1 \u2014 The terminology and definitions that apply to all KOBPIU-GF documents and across KOBPIU infrastructure as a whole. Controlled Documents \u2014 Technical specifications, standards, and policies that are independently maintained and versioned either by the KOB Consortia (e.g., the KOBPIU (TODO:-Change back) DID Method) or external standards bodies (e.g., W3C, OASIS). Another document, the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework , does not directly govern KOBPIU Infrastructure; rather it defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of KOBPIU actors, including the KOB Consortia, to the policies of the KOBPIU-GF.","title":"1.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this DPA will have the meaning given to them in the KSA or in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this DPA and the KSA, this DPA will govern. This DPA will survive termination of the KSA as long as Steward Processes Personal Data. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree as follows: 1. Definitions. \u201cGDPR\u201d means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, and any amendment or replacement to it. \u201cImpermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger and that a Steward Processes that is not Permissible Personal Data in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement. \u201cPermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data expressly listed in Schedule 1 that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement and that a Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means information that relates, directly or indirectly, to a data subject, including without limitation, names, email addresses, postal addresses, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of the data subject. \u201cProcess\u201d or \u201cProcessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Node Data, whether or not by automated means, such as the access, collection, use, storage, disclosure, dissemination, combination, recording, organization, structuring, adaption, alteration, copying, transfer, retrieval, consultation, disposal, restriction, erasure and/or destruction of Node Data. \u201cNode Data\u201d means any information which includes any Personal Data that Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cSecurity Breach\u201d means any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, any Node Data or otherwise affecting Steward\u2019s operation of the Steward Node in compliance with this DPA. \u201cKOBPIU Governance Framework\u201d means the KOB Foundation\u2019s governance policies and rules available here . (check again) \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d means the standard contractual clauses, as agreed by the European Commission, for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection as set out in Commission Decision C(2010) 593, as updated, amended replaced or superseded from time to time by the European Commission. (Check again) \u201cSubprocessor\u201d means any processor engaged by Steward who will access or receive Personal Data from Steward for Processing. The terms \u201ccontroller\u201d, \u201cdata subject\u201d, \u201cpersonal data\u201d, \u201cprocessor\u201d, and \u201csupervisory authority\u201d as used in this DPA will have the meanings ascribed to them in the GDPR. 2. Purpose of Processing Personal Data. In connection with performing its services obligations under the KSA (the \u201cServices\u201d) Steward may Process Node Data in accordance with this DPA. Specific details of the Processing activities including categories and type of Node Data that Steward will Process in connection with the KSA are set forth in Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing). 3. Processor and Controller Responsibilities. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree that the KOB Consortia is the legal entity that serves as the designated data controller for Personal Data written to the KOBPIU Ledger for the purpose of making decisions relating to the architecture, operation and governance of the KOBPIU Network and being the point of contact as explained in Section 3(c) below. Therefore, the parties acknowledge and agree that: (a) Steward is a processor of Node Data under the GDPR and (b) the KOB Consortia is the designated controller of Node Data under the GDPR and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to it as data controller. Transaction Authors are independent controllers of any Personal Data they write to the KOBPIU Ledger. Transaction Authors and the KOB Consortia independently determine the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. In no event will Transaction Authors be deemed joint controllers with the KOB Consortia under Article 26 of the GDPR or deemed to jointly determine and control the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. The KOB Consortia will provide the list of all other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) on behalf of which the Steward Processes Personal Data through the KOBPIU Ledger by referring Stewards to information available on the KOBPIU Ledger. As an accommodation to Steward, the KOB Consortia shall serve as the administrative coordinator for a Transaction Author\u2019s exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under the GDPR by serving as a single point of contact for Steward and by obtaining all necessary permissions from the other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) for the Processing of the Node Data. Steward shall be discharged of its obligation to inform or notify another Controller when it has provided such information or notice required under the GDPR to the KOB Consortia. Similarly, Steward will serve as a single point of contact for KOB Consortia with respect to its obligations as a processor under this DPA.However, in no event will the KOB Consortia be held liable for the actions or omissions of any Transaction Author arising out of any Personal Data that such Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in breach of the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, including but not limited to any Impermissible Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Transaction Author writes Permissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger in express compliance with the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, the KOB Consortia is responsible for the lawfulness of such Processing once such Permissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger. 4. Steward Responsibilities. Steward will: Process Node Data only in accordance with the KOBPIU Governance Framework and other lawful documented instructions (\u201cAdditional Instruction\u201d) from the KOB Consortia. If Steward notifies KOB Consortia that such other instruction is not feasible, the parties shall work together to find an alternative. If neither the Additional Instruction nor an alternative is feasible, the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services pursuant to the KSA. Steward will inform the KOB Consortia if it is aware or reasonably suspects that the KOB Foundation\u2019s instructions regarding the Processing of Node Data may breach the GDPR and may suspend the performance of such instruction until the KOB Consortia has modified the instruction or confirmed its lawfulness in documented form; ensure that persons authorized to Process the Node Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality even if such Node Data is public or already in the possession of Steward; promptly notify and reasonably assist the KOB Consortia, if it receives a request from a data subject for access to, correction, amendment, deletion of or objection to the Processing of Node Data relating to such individual; assist the KOB Consortia, at the KOB Foundation\u2019s request, in complying with the KOB Foundation\u2019s obligations to respond to data subject requests and its compliance regarding Node Data Processed by Steward, to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Steward; at the direction of the KOB Consortia, cooperate and assist the KOB Consortia in conducting a data protection impact assessment and related consultations with any supervisory authority; and comply with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to Steward as a processor in Processing the Node Data and in the performance of the Services. 5. Subprocessors . The KOB Consortia generally authorizes the use of Subprocessors to Process Node Data in connection with fulfilling Steward\u2019s obligations under the KSA and/or this DPA; provided that such Subprocessors meet the requirements set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Steward will remain fully responsible for fulfilment of its obligations under this DPA and will remain the primary point of contact regarding any Processing of Node Data. Steward will be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors and anyone else to which the Processing of Node Data or operation of the Node has been delegated by it. Steward will impose contractual obligations on its Subprocessors that are at least equivalent to those obligations imposed on Steward under this DPA. Upon KOB Foundation\u2019s request, KOB Consortia has the right to review and recommend changes to the relevant subprocessing contract between Steward and its 4 Subprocessors, and Steward will reasonably comply with such request. Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing (email acceptable) of any proposed changes to its Subprocessors and give the KOB Consortia the opportunity to object to such changes. Within thirty (30) days after Steward notifies the KOB Consortia of the intended change, the KOB Consortia can object to the addition of a Subprocessor on the basis that such addition would cause the KOB Consortia to violate the GDPR or other applicable privacy laws. Such objection shall be in writing and include specific reasons for its objection and reasonable options to mitigate, if any. If the KOB Consortia does not object within such period, the respective Subprocessor will be permitted to Process Node Data. If the KOB Consortia objects to the addition of a Subprocessor in accordance with this Section 5 and Steward cannot reasonably accommodate such objection, Steward will promptly notify it in writing stating in reasonable detail the reason for such inability to accommodate such objection. In such event, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to find a feasible workaround; provided that, if the parties are unable to find a feasible workaround within thirty (30) days of Steward\u2019s notice, then the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services as set out in the KSA without any liability to Steward. 6. Data Transfers . For all Stewards not based in the European Economic Area (EEA) (check again) , by signing this DPA, each party is deemed to have signed the Standard Contractual Clauses, attached hereto as Schedule 2, with the KOB Consortia, on its own and on behalf of the respective Transaction Authors, as the \u201cData Exporter\u201d and Steward as the \u201cData Importer\u201d (as each of these terms is defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). If a Subprocessor of Steward is a Data Importer, Steward agrees that it will enter into the EU controller to non-EU or EEA processor Standard Contractual Clauses on behalf of such Subprocessor if it is an affiliate of Steward, otherwise Steward will enter into a written agreement imposing obligations on such Subprocessor at least as stringent as those imposed on Steward in accordance with Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. 7. Security Safeguards . Steward will implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive written information security policy that contains appropriate technical and organizational measures (the \u201cSteward TOMs\u201d) to protect the security and confidentiality of Node Data. The Steward TOMs will be appropriate to the Node Data that Steward Processes and will meet the requirements set forth in Article 32 of the GDPR, the KSA and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. The Steward TOMs will meet the standards in Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto and the Steward Technical and Organizational Policies as set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework (the \u201cSteward TOPs\u201d). The parties agree the Steward TOPS satisfy the requirements of this Section 7. The KOB Consortia may update the Steward TOPs pursuant to the KOBPIU Governance Framework in light of the development and progression of technology. Such updates will be communicated to Steward via electronic communication and/or notification on the KOB Consortia website. Accordingly, Steward reserves the right to implement Steward TOMs that exceed the requirements of the Steward TOPs; provided that the functionality and security of the Services are not degraded. 8. Audits . Upon reasonable notice to Steward, the KOB Consortia may conduct or may engage an independent third party which shall not be a direct competitor of Steward and shall be bound to obligations of confidentiality (\u201cAuditor\u201d) to conduct an information security audit of Steward to meet its audit requirements under Article 28 of the GDPR and its obligations under Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. Prior to commencement of the audit, the parties will agree in writing to the terms and conditions governing the conduct of the audit. Steward will reasonably cooperate with the KOB Consortia and/or its Auditor in conducting such audit; provided that, nothing in this DPA will require Steward to provide information to the KOB Consortia that is publicly available on the KOBPIU Ledger. KOB Consortia agrees to reimburse reasonable and documented expenses incurred by Steward related to any information security audit initiated by KOB Consortia. 9. Security Breach . Without undue delay after becoming aware, Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing of any actual Security Breach. Steward will promptly investigate any Security Breach and is obligated to expend no more than an amount mutually agreed between KOB Consortia and Steward. Any additional amount of required expenditure will be the obligation of KOB Consortia consistent with Section 13 below. Steward will provide the KOB Consortia with reasonable assistance to satisfy any legal obligations of the KOB Consortia in relation to such Security Breach (including any obligation to notify data protection authorities or data subjects). In the event of a Security Breach, the KOB Consortia has the right to control the breach notification process, unless the GDPR dictates otherwise. 10. Return or Destruction of Node Data . Upon termination or expiration of the KSA and to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network, Steward will return to the KOB Consortia or destroy all Node Data and all copies thereof in its possession or under its control as specified in the Steward TOPs, except to the extent that Steward is required under the GDPR to keep a copy of the Node Data. 11. Records . In addition to the record provided by the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward will keep at its normal place of business all information relating to Steward\u2019s Processing of Node Data as described in the Steward TOPs and in this DPA pursuant to Article 28(h) of the GDPR. Steward will make such documents and all other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations in Article 28(h) of the GDPR available to the KOB Consortia upon request. 12. Limitation of Liability . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the KSA, a party\u2019s liability for breach of its obligations including any claims arising from this DPA or the Standard Contractual Clauses, will be limited as set forth below. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS DPA,INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA EXCEED $250,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA SHALL NOT EXCEED $500,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, THERE SHALL BE NO DOLLAR CAP ON SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA. (Check the figures again) However, in the event of any conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and this Section 12, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail but only with respect to claims arising from the Standard Contractual Clauses. As the KOB Consortia is entering into this DPA on behalf of itself and the Transaction Authors, the KOB Consortia will secure a Transaction Author\u2019s consent to the limitation of liability set forth in this Section 12 through the Transaction Author Agreement. Therefore a Transaction Author will be considered a \u201cparty\u201d as used in this Section 12 for the purpose of interpreting this limitation of liability. Without prejudice to Art. 82 of GDPR and for the avoidance of doubt, no controller will be jointly and severally liable with any other controller to Steward or vice versa. 13. Assistance : The KOB Consortia will make a written request to Steward for any assistance referred to in this DPA. Steward and the KOB Consortia will mutually agree in writing to a reasonable charge for Steward to perform such assistance or an Additional Instruction. If the parties do not mutually agree to such reasonable charge, the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to find a feasible solution. 14. Disputes . The parties will make good faith efforts to first resolve internally any dispute under this DPA. Neither party will seek any external remedies until thirty (30) days have elapsed from the initiation of such good faith efforts. At the conclusion of any such thirty (30) day period, each party shall be entitled as a matter of right to seek remedies for any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, relating to, involving, or having any connection with this DPA, including any question regarding the validity, interpretation, scope, performance, or enforceability of this dispute resolution provision, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in equity or otherwise. The rights conferred upon the parties by the preceding sentence shall not be exclusive of any other rights or remedies which each party may have at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties hereto have caused this DPA to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.

TODO: Check the entire schedule 2 again Schedule 2 - Standarad Contractual Clauses Commission Decision C (2010)593 For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection Name of the data exporting organisation: The KOB Consortia, on its own behalf and on behalf of applicable Transaction Authors who may act as independent controllers for purposes of these clauses. (the data exporter) And The Steward named in the KSA (the data importer) each a \u201cparty\u201d; together \u201cthe parties\u201d, HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1. TODO: Clause 1 Page:10 Clause 2 Details of the transfer The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses. Clause 3 Third-party beneficiary clause The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. Clause 4 Obligations of the data exporter The data exporter agrees and warrants: that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State; that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract; that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation; that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC (check again) ; to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i). Clause 5 Obligations of the data importer The data importer agrees and warrants: to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred; that it will promptly notify the data exporter about: any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, any accidental or unauthorised access, and any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so; to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred; at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority; to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter; that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent; that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the date exporter. Clause 6 Liability The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. Clause 7 Mediation and jurisdiction The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority; to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. Clause 8 Cooperation with supervisory authorities The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). Clause 9 Governing Law The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. Clause 10 Variation of the contract The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause. Clause 11 Sub-processing The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses( ). Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations 3 under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority. Clause 12 Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this DPA will have the meaning given to them in the KSA or in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this DPA and the KSA, this DPA will govern. This DPA will survive termination of the KSA as long as Steward Processes Personal Data. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree as follows: 1. Definitions. \u201cGDPR\u201d means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, and any amendment or replacement to it. \u201cImpermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger and that a Steward Processes that is not Permissible Personal Data in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement. \u201cPermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data expressly listed in Schedule 1 that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement and that a Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means information that relates, directly or indirectly, to a data subject, including without limitation, names, email addresses, postal addresses, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of the data subject. \u201cProcess\u201d or \u201cProcessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Node Data, whether or not by automated means, such as the access, collection, use, storage, disclosure, dissemination, combination, recording, organization, structuring, adaption, alteration, copying, transfer, retrieval, consultation, disposal, restriction, erasure and/or destruction of Node Data. \u201cNode Data\u201d means any information which includes any Personal Data that Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cSecurity Breach\u201d means any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, any Node Data or otherwise affecting Steward\u2019s operation of the Steward Node in compliance with this DPA. \u201cKOBPIU Governance Framework\u201d means the KOB Foundation\u2019s governance policies and rules available here . (check again) \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d means the standard contractual clauses, as agreed by the European Commission, for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection as set out in Commission Decision C(2010) 593, as updated, amended replaced or superseded from time to time by the European Commission. (Check again) \u201cSubprocessor\u201d means any processor engaged by Steward who will access or receive Personal Data from Steward for Processing. The terms \u201ccontroller\u201d, \u201cdata subject\u201d, \u201cpersonal data\u201d, \u201cprocessor\u201d, and \u201csupervisory authority\u201d as used in this DPA will have the meanings ascribed to them in the GDPR. 2. Purpose of Processing Personal Data. In connection with performing its services obligations under the KSA (the \u201cServices\u201d) Steward may Process Node Data in accordance with this DPA. Specific details of the Processing activities including categories and type of Node Data that Steward will Process in connection with the KSA are set forth in Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing). 3. Processor and Controller Responsibilities. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree that the KOB Consortia is the legal entity that serves as the designated data controller for Personal Data written to the KOBPIU Ledger for the purpose of making decisions relating to the architecture, operation and governance of the KOBPIU Network and being the point of contact as explained in Section 3(c) below. Therefore, the parties acknowledge and agree that: (a) Steward is a processor of Node Data under the GDPR and (b) the KOB Consortia is the designated controller of Node Data under the GDPR and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to it as data controller. Transaction Authors are independent controllers of any Personal Data they write to the KOBPIU Ledger. Transaction Authors and the KOB Consortia independently determine the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. In no event will Transaction Authors be deemed joint controllers with the KOB Consortia under Article 26 of the GDPR or deemed to jointly determine and control the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. The KOB Consortia will provide the list of all other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) on behalf of which the Steward Processes Personal Data through the KOBPIU Ledger by referring Stewards to information available on the KOBPIU Ledger. As an accommodation to Steward, the KOB Consortia shall serve as the administrative coordinator for a Transaction Author\u2019s exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under the GDPR by serving as a single point of contact for Steward and by obtaining all necessary permissions from the other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) for the Processing of the Node Data. Steward shall be discharged of its obligation to inform or notify another Controller when it has provided such information or notice required under the GDPR to the KOB Consortia. Similarly, Steward will serve as a single point of contact for KOB Consortia with respect to its obligations as a processor under this DPA.However, in no event will the KOB Consortia be held liable for the actions or omissions of any Transaction Author arising out of any Personal Data that such Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in breach of the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, including but not limited to any Impermissible Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Transaction Author writes Permissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger in express compliance with the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, the KOB Consortia is responsible for the lawfulness of such Processing once such Permissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger. 4. Steward Responsibilities. Steward will: Process Node Data only in accordance with the KOBPIU Governance Framework and other lawful documented instructions (\u201cAdditional Instruction\u201d) from the KOB Consortia. If Steward notifies KOB Consortia that such other instruction is not feasible, the parties shall work together to find an alternative. If neither the Additional Instruction nor an alternative is feasible, the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services pursuant to the KSA. Steward will inform the KOB Consortia if it is aware or reasonably suspects that the KOB Foundation\u2019s instructions regarding the Processing of Node Data may breach the GDPR and may suspend the performance of such instruction until the KOB Consortia has modified the instruction or confirmed its lawfulness in documented form; ensure that persons authorized to Process the Node Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality even if such Node Data is public or already in the possession of Steward; promptly notify and reasonably assist the KOB Consortia, if it receives a request from a data subject for access to, correction, amendment, deletion of or objection to the Processing of Node Data relating to such individual; assist the KOB Consortia, at the KOB Foundation\u2019s request, in complying with the KOB Foundation\u2019s obligations to respond to data subject requests and its compliance regarding Node Data Processed by Steward, to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Steward; at the direction of the KOB Consortia, cooperate and assist the KOB Consortia in conducting a data protection impact assessment and related consultations with any supervisory authority; and comply with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to Steward as a processor in Processing the Node Data and in the performance of the Services. 5. Subprocessors . The KOB Consortia generally authorizes the use of Subprocessors to Process Node Data in connection with fulfilling Steward\u2019s obligations under the KSA and/or this DPA; provided that such Subprocessors meet the requirements set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Steward will remain fully responsible for fulfilment of its obligations under this DPA and will remain the primary point of contact regarding any Processing of Node Data. Steward will be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors and anyone else to which the Processing of Node Data or operation of the Node has been delegated by it. Steward will impose contractual obligations on its Subprocessors that are at least equivalent to those obligations imposed on Steward under this DPA. Upon KOB Foundation\u2019s request, KOB Consortia has the right to review and recommend changes to the relevant subprocessing contract between Steward and its 4 Subprocessors, and Steward will reasonably comply with such request. Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing (email acceptable) of any proposed changes to its Subprocessors and give the KOB Consortia the opportunity to object to such changes. Within thirty (30) days after Steward notifies the KOB Consortia of the intended change, the KOB Consortia can object to the addition of a Subprocessor on the basis that such addition would cause the KOB Consortia to violate the GDPR or other applicable privacy laws. Such objection shall be in writing and include specific reasons for its objection and reasonable options to mitigate, if any. If the KOB Consortia does not object within such period, the respective Subprocessor will be permitted to Process Node Data. If the KOB Consortia objects to the addition of a Subprocessor in accordance with this Section 5 and Steward cannot reasonably accommodate such objection, Steward will promptly notify it in writing stating in reasonable detail the reason for such inability to accommodate such objection. In such event, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to find a feasible workaround; provided that, if the parties are unable to find a feasible workaround within thirty (30) days of Steward\u2019s notice, then the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services as set out in the KSA without any liability to Steward. 6. Data Transfers . For all Stewards not based in the European Economic Area (EEA) (check again) , by signing this DPA, each party is deemed to have signed the Standard Contractual Clauses, attached hereto as Schedule 2, with the KOB Consortia, on its own and on behalf of the respective Transaction Authors, as the \u201cData Exporter\u201d and Steward as the \u201cData Importer\u201d (as each of these terms is defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). If a Subprocessor of Steward is a Data Importer, Steward agrees that it will enter into the EU controller to non-EU or EEA processor Standard Contractual Clauses on behalf of such Subprocessor if it is an affiliate of Steward, otherwise Steward will enter into a written agreement imposing obligations on such Subprocessor at least as stringent as those imposed on Steward in accordance with Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. 7. Security Safeguards . Steward will implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive written information security policy that contains appropriate technical and organizational measures (the \u201cSteward TOMs\u201d) to protect the security and confidentiality of Node Data. The Steward TOMs will be appropriate to the Node Data that Steward Processes and will meet the requirements set forth in Article 32 of the GDPR, the KSA and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. The Steward TOMs will meet the standards in Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto and the Steward Technical and Organizational Policies as set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework (the \u201cSteward TOPs\u201d). The parties agree the Steward TOPS satisfy the requirements of this Section 7. The KOB Consortia may update the Steward TOPs pursuant to the KOBPIU Governance Framework in light of the development and progression of technology. Such updates will be communicated to Steward via electronic communication and/or notification on the KOB Consortia website. Accordingly, Steward reserves the right to implement Steward TOMs that exceed the requirements of the Steward TOPs; provided that the functionality and security of the Services are not degraded. 8. Audits . Upon reasonable notice to Steward, the KOB Consortia may conduct or may engage an independent third party which shall not be a direct competitor of Steward and shall be bound to obligations of confidentiality (\u201cAuditor\u201d) to conduct an information security audit of Steward to meet its audit requirements under Article 28 of the GDPR and its obligations under Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. Prior to commencement of the audit, the parties will agree in writing to the terms and conditions governing the conduct of the audit. Steward will reasonably cooperate with the KOB Consortia and/or its Auditor in conducting such audit; provided that, nothing in this DPA will require Steward to provide information to the KOB Consortia that is publicly available on the KOBPIU Ledger. KOB Consortia agrees to reimburse reasonable and documented expenses incurred by Steward related to any information security audit initiated by KOB Consortia. 9. Security Breach . Without undue delay after becoming aware, Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing of any actual Security Breach. Steward will promptly investigate any Security Breach and is obligated to expend no more than an amount mutually agreed between KOB Consortia and Steward. Any additional amount of required expenditure will be the obligation of KOB Consortia consistent with Section 13 below. Steward will provide the KOB Consortia with reasonable assistance to satisfy any legal obligations of the KOB Consortia in relation to such Security Breach (including any obligation to notify data protection authorities or data subjects). In the event of a Security Breach, the KOB Consortia has the right to control the breach notification process, unless the GDPR dictates otherwise. 10. Return or Destruction of Node Data . Upon termination or expiration of the KSA and to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network, Steward will return to the KOB Consortia or destroy all Node Data and all copies thereof in its possession or under its control as specified in the Steward TOPs, except to the extent that Steward is required under the GDPR to keep a copy of the Node Data. 11. Records . In addition to the record provided by the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward will keep at its normal place of business all information relating to Steward\u2019s Processing of Node Data as described in the Steward TOPs and in this DPA pursuant to Article 28(h) of the GDPR. Steward will make such documents and all other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations in Article 28(h) of the GDPR available to the KOB Consortia upon request. 12. Limitation of Liability . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the KSA, a party\u2019s liability for breach of its obligations including any claims arising from this DPA or the Standard Contractual Clauses, will be limited as set forth below. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS DPA,INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA EXCEED $250,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA SHALL NOT EXCEED $500,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, THERE SHALL BE NO DOLLAR CAP ON SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA. (Check the figures again) However, in the event of any conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and this Section 12, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail but only with respect to claims arising from the Standard Contractual Clauses. As the KOB Consortia is entering into this DPA on behalf of itself and the Transaction Authors, the KOB Consortia will secure a Transaction Author\u2019s consent to the limitation of liability set forth in this Section 12 through the Transaction Author Agreement. Therefore a Transaction Author will be considered a \u201cparty\u201d as used in this Section 12 for the purpose of interpreting this limitation of liability. Without prejudice to Art. 82 of GDPR and for the avoidance of doubt, no controller will be jointly and severally liable with any other controller to Steward or vice versa. 13. Assistance : The KOB Consortia will make a written request to Steward for any assistance referred to in this DPA. Steward and the KOB Consortia will mutually agree in writing to a reasonable charge for Steward to perform such assistance or an Additional Instruction. If the parties do not mutually agree to such reasonable charge, the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to find a feasible solution. 14. Disputes . The parties will make good faith efforts to first resolve internally any dispute under this DPA. Neither party will seek any external remedies until thirty (30) days have elapsed from the initiation of such good faith efforts. At the conclusion of any such thirty (30) day period, each party shall be entitled as a matter of right to seek remedies for any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, relating to, involving, or having any connection with this DPA, including any question regarding the validity, interpretation, scope, performance, or enforceability of this dispute resolution provision, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in equity or otherwise. The rights conferred upon the parties by the preceding sentence shall not be exclusive of any other rights or remedies which each party may have at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties hereto have caused this DPA to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.

Types of Personal Data : Permissible Personal Data : Public DIDs, public keys, and any other Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement. Impermissible Personal Data : The KOBPIU Governance Framework prohibits writing of Impermissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger. If Impermissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward has no obligation or liability with respect to such Impermissible Personal Data, except to promptly notify the KOB Consortia in writing. Categories of Data Subjects : Node Data may belong to any of the following categories of data subjects: Transaction Authors who are natural persons Order of precedence The KOB Consortia may update the content of this Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing), including the types of Permissible Personal Data and Impermissible Personal Data, from time to time by updating the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Solely with reference to the details of the Processing of the Node Data included in this Schedule 1, in case of conflict, the KOBPIU Governance Framework will prevail over the present Schedule 1. TODO: Check the entire schedule 2 again Schedule 2 - Standarad Contractual Clauses Commission Decision C (2010)593 For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection Name of the data exporting organisation: The KOB Consortia, on its own behalf and on behalf of applicable Transaction Authors who may act as independent controllers for purposes of these clauses. (the data exporter) And The Steward named in the KSA (the data importer) each a \u201cparty\u201d; together \u201cthe parties\u201d, HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1. TODO: Clause 1 Page:10 Clause 2 Details of the transfer The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses. Clause 3 Third-party beneficiary clause The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. Clause 4 Obligations of the data exporter The data exporter agrees and warrants: that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State; that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract; that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation; that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC (check again) ; to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i). Clause 5 Obligations of the data importer The data importer agrees and warrants: to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred; that it will promptly notify the data exporter about: any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, any accidental or unauthorised access, and any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so; to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred; at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority; to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter; that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent; that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the date exporter. Clause 6 Liability The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. Clause 7 Mediation and jurisdiction The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority; to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. Clause 8 Cooperation with supervisory authorities The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). Clause 9 Governing Law The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. Clause 10 Variation of the contract The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause. Clause 11 Sub-processing The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses( ). Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations 3 under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority. Clause 12 Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

The KOBPIU Governance Framework and KOBPIU Glossary (Add link to glossary) is incorporated into this Agreement by reference only for purposes of use of such defined terms. 2)Permission to Write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks The KOB Consortia hereby grants to Transaction Author a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty free, revocable license to write to and use the KOBPIU Ledger Networks in accordance with this Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. When authoring Transactions under the policy of Permissioned Write Access, a Transaction Author may only write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by using an authorized Transaction Endorser. In the event that KOB Consortia enables Public Write Access to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks, the Transaction Author will not need a Transaction Endorser to endorse a Transaction. Once an initial Transaction has been written to one of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by the Transaction Author (\u201cInitial Transaction\u201d), the Transaction Author is granted permission to make additional Transactions to update the state of a previous Transaction (\u201cUpdate Transactions\u201d). Please note, an Update Transaction does not remove the Initial Transaction, which will remain on the KOBPIU Ledger due to its immutability and may remain on KOBPIU Test Networks unless they are reset. Transaction Author may make Update Transactions if and only if the Transaction Author was the author of the Initial Transaction. Update Transactions are Transactions and are subject to all the terms of this Agreement. 3) Transaction Author Obligations With regard to all Transactions, Transaction Author will: comply with any requirements imposed by the Transaction Endorser on the Transaction Author and any Transactions endorsed by the Transaction Endorser; not write Transactions containing Personal Data until KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transactions to contain Personal Data pursuant to Section 3(b) below. If the KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transaction Authors to write Transactions that contain Permissible Personal Data (\u201cPersonal Data Transactions\u201d), then Transaction Author expressly agrees that: It will not write any Transactions that contain Impermissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks; it is an independent data controller (as defined in the GDPR) of the Personal Data Transactions and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the Data Protection Laws; it acknowledges and will notify all data subjects whose Personal Data it Processes that functions inherent in blockchain technology may render fulfilling data subject requests difficult or impossible. For example, due to blockchain\u2019s immutability, data stored on a blockchain generally cannot be removed or altered once the data is confirmed on the blockchain; it irrevocably waives any and all claims, rights and/or obligations it may have now or in the future against the KOB Consortia as a result of being unable to fulfill data subject requests in accordance with Data Protection Laws; it agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to Transaction Author as a controller of Personal Data Transactions under the Data Processing Agreements with Stewards and Transaction Endorsers, each in their roles as processors under the GDPR, and attached as Appendices A and B (the \u201cDPAs\u201d); that the KOB Consortia has the right to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and the DPAs are made a part of the Agreement in their entirety; by signing this Agreement, each Party is deemed to have signed the DPAs, including the Standard Contractual Clauses with the KOB Consortia and Transaction Author as the \u201cData exporter,\u201d and with either a Steward or a Transaction Endorser as \u201cData importer,\u201d as applicable; at the KOB Consortia\u2019s request, the Transaction Author will reimburse the KOB Consortia for any costs incurred by the KOB Consortia in enforcing the Transaction Author\u2019s rights under the GDPR, including but not limited to fulfillment of data subject rights, rights of oversight and audit, etc.; and it irrevocably waives any and all claims that it may have now or in the future that the KOB Consortia lacks the rights to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and bind Transaction Author to the DPAs\u2019 terms and conditions, including the limitation of liability therein. 4) Term and Termination This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in force until terminated by either Party pursuant to this Section 4 (Term and Termination). Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (i) if the other Party has materially defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement and has not cured such default within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of written notice from the non-defaulting Party of such default or (ii) immediately in the event of any government sanctions or other legal measures that make it unlawful for Transaction Author to write Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Additionally, Transaction Author may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days\u2019 advance written notice to the KOB Consortia and ceasing all use of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason the rights granted to Transaction Author by the KOB Consortia under this Agreement automatically terminate. 5) Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer By KOB Consortia.

Transaction Endorser agrees to promptly notify the KOBPIU Parties in writing of any Claims, cooperate with the KOBPIU Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys\u2019 fees).

At the request of a Party, the arbitrator may at his or her discretion order the deposition of witnesses. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three depositions per Party, each of a maximum of four hours duration, unless the arbitrator otherwise determines.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring a proceeding seeking equitable or injunctive relief solely and exclusively in the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, to prevent the infringement of intellectual property rights or the disclosure of confidential information. Each Party hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication of any such equitable or injunctive relief, as well as for any such matters that are excluded from or fall outside of this arbitration provision. 8) Limitation of Liability EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.

KOB is a technology demonstrator to launch a DID based public identity utility compliant with the ToIP standards to enable Trusted digital verification service for various association within the city of Kochi.\u200b There are three main stakeholders for KochiOrgBook - Citizens of Kochi , Associations in Kochi and Digital Service Providers . The motivators for these stakeholders are, Stakeholders Motivators Citizens - Ownership of one's digital identity - Privacy - Trusted digital services offering. Associations - Ownership of one's digital identity - Privacy - Trusted digital services offering. - Enhance confidency and trust on digital service providers. - Dedicated community cloud for availing shared infra. - Low expense in hosting a node for associations who doesn't have the necessary infra.

The mission of the ToIP foundation is to simplify and standardize how trust is established online so that everyone can feel safe, secure, and private in all of our digital interactions \u2014 whether between individuals, businesses, governments, or any \u201cthing\u201d on the Internet of Things. DID \u2013 Decentralized Identifier DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. Each DID has associated with it one or more public keys created by the DID owner (and the owner holds the corresponding private keys), and one or more endpoints - addresses where messages can be delivered for that identity. A DID can be uniquely resolved (like a URL) to return the the data (public keys and endpoints) associated with the DID. Agents and Wallets It is hard to manage all the DIDs a person creates or receives. Indy uses the term \"Agent\" to mean the software that interacts with other entities, and the term \"Wallet\" as a data store for the DIDs and related information. For example, a person might have a mobile Agent app on their smart devices, while an Organization might have an enterprise Agent running on a Cloud Server. All Agents have a secure Wallet for storing identity data. A personal Agent wallet is similar to a password manager - there is a name for each relationship and associated data. However, unlike Password Managers that use things like your copy/paste clipboard for User IDs and Passwords and \"screen-scrape\" applications and websites, Agents communicate directly with Agents to accomplish Identity-related tasks. The picture below is an example of some communicating Indy Agents. The Edge Agents are handled by the Identity owners themselves - in this case a Consumer and an Enterprise. The Cloud Agents facilitate the messaging by, for example, providing a permanent endpoint for a device that may or may not be online at the time messages are being received. Credential Credentials are things like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees that are given to us from an issuing authority that we can use to show to others when needed. Verifiable Credential(VC) VCs are digital equivalents of paper credentials that are cryptographically processed such that when we show (\"prove\") the claims (data elements from the Credentials), the receiver (\"Verifier\") can be certain: - Who issued the claims - That the claims were issued to the Identity presenting them - That the claims have not been tampered with (forged), and - That the claims' Credential has not been revoked by the Issuer. As the image below shows, the data flow for Verifiable Credentials is the same as with paper documents - Issuers give Verifiable Credentials to the Holder, and the Holder can prove them to Verifiers at any time. Issuer, Holder, Verifier Issuer - Issues Verifiable Credentials to the Holder Holder - Holders request credentials from issuers, hold them in their wallets and present them when requested by verifiers Verifier - Verifies the claims presented by the Holder TIP \u2013 Trust over IP Interoperability Profile\u200b A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems. TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. TSWG \u2013 Technology Stack Working Group\u200b This working group (members) concerns a broadly defined and broadly applicable set of technologies (the \"stack of technology\") that can be used to promote the ability of project-level scientists to build web-based data and processing services that are readily found and used by others. Part of this effort is to promote interoperability between individual services in order to help scientists pursue more integrated science. GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation\u200b General Data Protection Regulation is meant to fundamentally reshape how personal data are collected and processed by giving all individuals living in the European Union (or the greater European Economic Area) new rights to access and control their data on the Internet. Identity Utility Network An Identity Utility Network associated with a DID Root Namespace that operates under its own Governance Framework. Digital Trust Ecosystem An interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that share a standardized trust model for mutually beneficial purposes, such as consumer and commercial interactions that are verifiable. DID Namespace Building on URI Standards, the DID Specification allows for both root namespace (did:xxx) and sub-namespace (did:xxx:yyy) conventions. Node A computer network server running an instance of the code necessary to operate a distributed ledger or blockchain. Browser wars A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation of browser war began, this time adding extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected. Credential Registry The Credential Registry is a cloud-based library that collects, maintains, and connects information on all types of credentials Digital Service Providers DSPs are providers of DID based solutions.

A few of the key use cases are listed below. Medical Practitioners Verifiable/Issuing Association - IMA(Kochi Chapter) Nobody can take risks when it comes to health. So, when someone is suffering from a health related issue, he/she will, most probably, consult an experienced and well renowned doctor. We usually ask our friends/relatives for recommendations on a good doctor or visit the highly rated hospital. Sometimes we even consult more than one doctor to get a second opinion regarding one's health issue. This practise can be time consuming and can be tiring as well. There are situations were the treatment should be given on time and in such a situation, this practise should not be followed. With KochiOrgBook, doctors will be issued a digital identity about who they are and what their qualification is and a normal citizen can access these informations from their fingertips. With this, an individual can make the best decisions on time and with ease. Lawyers Verifiable/Issuing Association - Bar Council of India(Kochi High Court Chapter) It is quite difficult to identity lawyers who are specialized in specific types of cases from public information as only their name and qualifications are made available. All lawyers may not be able to offer legal consultation services which makes it difficult for a citizen to approach the right lawyer without connections. This could take time and may impact the ability of an individual to contest legal claims at court efficiently. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen of the city of Kochi to verify that the Lawyer is qualified to handle or offer legal consultation on specific types of cases in a most efficient and trustworthy manner. Driving License\u200b Verifiable/Issuing Association - Regional Transport Office(Kochi) Anyone who needs to take up the driving license test should first prove their eligibility, mainly age. Other than age, one should give proof for their identity and address. Then the RTO department goes through the presented documents and declare one eligible, if they approve of it. This entire process can take up a lot of time and individuals will have to provide a number of documents to prove their eligibility and identity. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen to present digital proofs to take up driving license test leveraging capabilities of verifiable credentials and increase efficiency of the process. Verification services to provide specific digital identities Services - Email verification service, Phone number verification service, Address verification service Today, email-id and phone number are the most shared information throughout the internet. A person use their email-id/phone number to avail various services or share information or login to a particular website. But, even these credentials are misused for various illegal activities. This use case is focused on providing individual with basic verification services like Email verification service, Phone number verification service etc. With this each user can prove their ownership over their informations like email-id/phone number and they will be provided with a DID for these information which can be stored in a digital wallet app. Creating student credentials for applying admission to external Universities Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) Often a student will have to share multiple credential information for applying admission to external universities. The student would need to apply and secure many of these credentials from different source independently. Not every student may be well versed with the formalities involved this and this results in students incurring delays and cost for securing all the required credentials for applying to external Universities. Lack of transparency in the process also causes some students to miss out on the requesting credentials in specific format which forces them to miss out on apply for admissions. This use case is focused on enabling a student to collect all required digital credentials /proofs and submit them in a timely manner leveraging a workflow which offers transparency, enhance efficiency, and reduces cost to apply for admissions. University issued digital credential Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) In this use case, a student under a particular university will be issued a DID proving him/her a valid student under the university. By leveraging this DID, he/she can work through the university related processes with ease.","title":"Key Use Cases"},{"location":"gf_info/key_use_cases.html#key-use-cases","text":"This initiative can work around a number of use cases under a particular jurisdiction.

Version Control Version: 0.1 Governing Board Approval Date: TBD Comments: Ratification of the KOBPIU-GF will take place upon the formation of the Governing Board (at first meeting). Status: TBD Acknowledgements \u200bThis document was produced on behalf of the KOBPIU Governing Board by the KOBPIU Governance Framework Working Group. KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document 1. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the KOBPIU is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted commerce. The KOBPIU-GF works as the constitution for the KOBPIU. It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The KOBPIU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the KOBPIU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that consortium members may have as itility participants. The KOBPIU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents shown in blue and yellow in Figure(). The KOB Consortia will also publish additional operational documents, including white papers, FAQs, readiness checklists, design guidelines, sample schemas, etc., as needed. The documents are organized in three categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. The normative documents in the KOBPIU-GF V1 are: KOBPOIU Governance Framework Master Document V1 - The present document. Five legal agreements: KOBPIU Steward Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Stewards who operate Nodes of the KOBPIU. Transaction Author Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Identity Owners writing Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Transaction Endorser Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and Organizations using Permissioned Write Access. Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) V1 \u2014 The agreement under which Stewards serve as data processors from a data protection regulatory standpoint. Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement V1 \u2014 The DPA that applies to Transaction Endorsers. KOBPIU Glossary V1 \u2014 The terminology and definitions that apply to all KOBPIU-GF documents and across KOBPIU infrastructure as a whole. Controlled Documents \u2014 Technical specifications, standards, and policies that are independently maintained and versioned either by the KOB Consortia (e.g., the KOBPIU (TODO:-Change back) DID Method) or external standards bodies (e.g., W3C, OASIS). Another document, the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework , does not directly govern KOBPIU Infrastructure; rather it defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of KOBPIU actors, including the KOB Consortia, to the policies of the KOBPIU-GF. 2. CORE PRINCIPLES The following principles guide the development of policies in the KOBPIU-GF 2.1 Self-Sovereignty Individuals are endowed with and possess an inalienable right to be Identity Owners with the ability to permanently control one or more Self-Sovereign Identities without reliance on any external administrative authority. An Identity Owner alone shall determine which Identity Data describe its Identities. With regard to managing its own Identity Data, an Identity Owner alone shall determine how and for what purpose(s) it is processed. An Identity Owner alone shall determine who has access to its Identity Data. An Identity Owner\u2019s Identity Data shall be portable as determined by the Identity Owner and enabled via Open Standards. An Identity Owner alone shall have the right to Delegate control of these functions. 2.2 Guardianship An Individual who does not have the capability to directly control that Individual\u2019s Identity Data (a Dependent) shall have the right to appoint another Identity Owner who has that capability (an Independent or an Organization) to serve as the owner\u2019s Guardian. If a Dependent does not have the capability to directly appoint a Guardian, the Dependent shall still have the right to have a Guardian appointed to act on the Dependent\u2019s behalf. A Dependent has the right tobecome an Independent by claiming full control of the Dependent\u2019s Identity Data. A Guardian has the obligation to promptly assist in this process provided the Dependent can demonstrate that the Dependent has the necessary capabilities. Guardianship shall not be confused with Delegation or Impersonation. Guardianship under the KOBPIU Governance Framework should be mapped in the proper contexts to various legal constructs, including legal guardianship , power of attorney , conservatorship , living trusts , and so on. 2.3 Openness and Interoperability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall use Open Standards and avoid mechanisms that would prevent Identity Owners from having interoperability or portability of their Identity Data both within the KOBPIU Network and with other networks and systems. 2.4 Accountability Identity Owners shall be accountable to each other for conformance to the purpose, principles, and policies of the KOBPIU Governance Framework. All KOBPIU Entities shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with any other requirements of applicable law. Nothing in the KOBPIU Governance Framework shall require a KOBPIU Entity to breach applicable law in order for it to perform its obligations under the KOBPIU Governance Framework. 2.5 Sustainability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and operated to be technically, economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable for the long term. 2.6 Transparency The KOB Consortia shall practice Open Governance, and the KOB Consortia and the Stewards in their KOBPIU Ledger Roles shall operate with full openness and transparency to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the principles herein, including the proceedings of the KOBPIU Board of Trustees and all KOBPIU Governing Bodies, the development and distribution of KOBPIU Open Source Code, the qualification and operation of Stewards, and any revisions to the KOBPIU Governance Framework. 2.7 Collective Best Interest The KOB Consortia shall act in the collective best interests of all Identity Owners and shall not favor the interests of any single Identity Owner or group of Identity Owners over the interests of the KOB Consortia as a whole. Note that at present the KOBPIU Governance Framework has no self-enforcing distributed mechanism that neutralises differences of interest among different stakeholders participating in the network, therefore this is the responsibility of the KOB Consortia. Future versions of the KOBPIU Governance Framework shall aim to provide such mechanisms. 2.8 Decentralization by Design 2.8.1 General KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be decentralized to the greatest extent possible consistent with the other principles herein. As the business, legal, and technical limitations of decentralization may change over time, the KOB Consortia shall continuously examine all points of control, decision, and governance to seek ongoing conformance with this principle. 2.8.2 Diffuse Trust KOBPIU Infrastructure shall not concentrate power in any single Individual, Organization, Jurisdiction, Industry Sector, or other special interest to the detriment of the Network as a whole. Diffuse Trust shall take into account all forms of diversity among Identity Owners. 2.8.3 Web of Trust KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed to not favor any single root of trust, but empower any KOBPIU Entity to serve as a root of trust and enable all KOBPIU Entities to participate in any number of interwoven Trust Communities. 2.8.4 Censorship Resistance KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed to resist censorship of any Entity while remaining compliant with all applicable laws. 2.8.5 High Availability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented to maximize availability of the KOBPIU Network. 2.8.6 No Single Point of Failure KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented to not have any single point of failure . 2.8.7 Regenerative KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed so that failed components can be quickly and easily replaced by other components. 2.8.8 Distributive KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented such that authority is vested, functions performed, and resources used by the smallest or most local part of the KOB Consortia that includes all relevant and affected parties. Deliberations should be conducted and decisions made by bodies and methods that reasonably represent all relevant and affected parties and are dominated by none. 2.8.9 Innovation at the Edge The continued development of the KOBPIU Infrastructure shall encourage innovation to take place at the edges of the network among the members of the KOB Consortia most directly involved or impacted. 2.9 Inclusive by Design 2.9.1 General The design, governance, and operation of KOBPIU Infrastructure shall follow the principles of Inclusive Design to serve the widest possible community of Identity Owners. 2.9.2 Identity for All Consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 , the KOB Consortia and the KOBPIU Network shall promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; enable access to justice for all; and facilitate effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels by being accessible to, and inclusive of all Identity Owners without discrimination and with accommodation for physical, economic, or other limitations of Identity Owners to the greatest extent feasible. 2.9.3 People-Centered Design KOBPIU Developers shall put people at the heart of the design process and enable them to control their own user experience. 2.9.4 Design for Difference KOBPIU Developers shall strive to understand differences in capabilities and preferences across all potential members of the KOB Consortia and provide adaptable solutions to meet the needs of all potential members. 2.9.5 Test Across Contexts KOBPIU Developers shall test KOBPIU solutions for use in different Identity Owner environments and contexts. 2.9.6 Offer Choice KOBPIU Developers shall design flexibility by offering a choice of ways to achieve the same outcome. 2.9.7 Maintain Consistent Experience KOBPIU Developers shall design comparable experiences for all of their user communities that use consistent design elements and language. 2.10 Privacy by Design 2.10.1 General The design, governance, and operation of KOBPIU Infrastructure shall follow the Seven Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design to the greatest extent possible consistent with the other principles herein. These principles can be summarized as: Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial Privacy as the Default Setting Privacy Embedded into Design Full Functionality\u2014Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum End-to-End Security\u2014Full Lifecycle Protection Visibility and Transparency\u2014Keep it Open Respect for User Privacy\u2014Keep it User-Centric 2.10.2 Pairwise Pseudonyms by Default Agents using the KOBPIU Protocol shall default to assigning Pairwise Pseudonyms, Pairwise Public Keys, and, when necessary, Pairwise Service Endpoints whenever forming a Connection unless specifically directed otherwise by an Identity Owner. 2.10.3 Selective Disclosure by Default Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers using the KOBPIU Protocol shall default to issuing, holding, and accepting Credentials that support Zero-Knowledge Proofs and privacy-respecting Revocation Registries by default. 2.10.4 Governance Framework Disclosure by Default KOBPIU Entities shall by default disclose the Governance Framework under which a Connection is created, an Interaction is performed, or a Credential is exchanged. Agents shall by default notify their Identity Owner of any conflict between the Identity Owner\u2019s privacy preferences and the Governance Framework\u2019s privacy policies. 2.10.5 Owner Controlled Storage by Default Agents shall store Private Data in decentralized data storage controlled by the Identity Owner by default. 2.10.6 Anti-Correlation by Design and Default KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and implemented to avoid correlation of an Identity Owner, or of a Thing associated with an Identity Owner, without the direct knowledge and informed consent of the Identity Owner. 2.10.7 Guardian and Delegate Confidentiality The use of a Guardian or Delegate may be confidential information and shall only be disclosed with the authorization of the Identity Owner and of the Guardian and/or Delegate. 2.11 Security by Design 2.11.1 General The design, governance, and operation of KOBPIU Infrastructure shall follow the principles of Security by Design to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the other principles herein. 2.11.2 System Diversity The process and policies for selecting Stewards shall optimize availability and security by maximizing diversity of hosting locations, environments, networks, and systems. 2.11.3 Secure Defaults The default configuration settings and user experience of the applications using KOBPIU Infrastructure shall enforce strong protection by default, including encryption by default. 2.11.4 Least Privilege Access and authorization of the applications, Agents, and network services that use and comprise KOBPIU Infrastructure shall subscribe to the concept of least privilege . 2.11.5 Anti-Impersonation Applications shall be designed to not knowingly allow any party other than the Identity Owner to act as (impersonate) the Identity Owner. Impersonation does not include Guardianship or Delegation. 2.11.6 Auditability Transactions in KOBPIU Infrastructure and actions of application using KOBPIU Infrastructure that require auditing shall be immutably logged, in a tamper-evident way, and be available to verify processing. 2.11.7 Secure Failure Applications using KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed to take an exception or error path that will not create a security weakness exploitable by bad actors. 2.11.8 Pervasive Mediation Applications using KOBPIU Infrastructure shall not assume authorization is transitive across time and/or space\u2014rather security mechanisms shall check every access to every object, and authorize each action on its own merits, just in time. 2.12 Data Protection by Design and Default 2.12.1 General KOBPIU Entities, in the processing of personal data, shall adhere to the following data protection principles to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the other principles herein. 2.12.2 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the Individual. 2.12.3 Purpose Limitation Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall not be considered incompatible with the original processing purposes. 2.12.4 Data Minimization Personal data must be relevant and limited to that which is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is being processed. 2.12.5 Accuracy Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that where personal data is inaccurate it is erased or rectified without delay. 2.12.6 Storage Limitation Personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of Individuals for no longer than the duration necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is being processed. 2.12.7 Integrity and Confidentiality Personal data must be processed in a manner that provides appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (i.e., information security) 3 CORE POLICIES 3.1 Stewardship In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design and Security by Design principles: Policies, practices, procedures, and algorithms governing participation of Stewards and operation of Nodes MUST follow all Core Principles. The KOB Consortia MUST publish the following Controlled Documents managed as specified by KOB Consortia : a. KOBPIU Steward Business Policies b. KOBPIU Steward Technical Policies. c. KOBPIU Ledger Access Policies. 3.2 Guardianship In keeping with the Guardianship principle, a Guardian SHOULD: Act in the Dependent person\u2019s best interest. Exercise good judgment and carefully manage responsibilities. Avoid commingling\u2014keep Dependent\u2019s property separate (e.g., separate DIDs, Public Keys, Wallets, Vaults, etc.). Keep detailed records of all actions taken on behalf of the Dependent. Not violate the Anti-Impersonation principle (section 2.11.5). Be subject to applicable legal structures regarding the granting and revocation of Guardianships. 3.3 Inclusion In keeping with the Inclusive by Design principles: Access to the KOBPIU Network MUST be open to all Individuals and Organizations on a comparable basis without intentional exclusion of specific persons or communities. Developers SHOULD design for different capabilities in different contexts considering: a. Digital Exclusion (e.g., access to connected devices) b. Physical or Cognitive Exclusion (e.g., disability or incapacity) c. Political & Social Status (e.g., stateless individuals; being a child or a woman) d. Financial Status (e.g., having no income) e. Literacy & Language (e.g., low literacy or not speaking local language) 3.4 Trust Assurance In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design principles: The KOB Consortia MUST specify policies, practices, and procedures for assessing conformance to the KOBPIU Governance Framework by publishing and maintaining the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework as a Controlled Document managed as specified by KOBPIU Governing Bodies. The KOBPIU Governance Framework MUST be designed to provide a foundation for Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks (DSGFs) based on the KOBPIU Web of TrustModel. As soon as feasible, the KOBPIU Foundation MUST publish a DSGF, the KOBPIU Web of Trust Governance Framework, whose purpose is to enable decentralized discovery,navigation, and verification of DSGFs. The KOBPIU Foundation MUST publish the KOBPIU Trust Mark Policies as a Controlled Document managed as specified by KOBPIU Governing Bodies. An Entity serving in one of the KOBPIU Infrastructure Roles who meets the requirements in the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework MAY use the appropriate KOBPIU Trust Mark as specified in KOBPIU Trust Mark Policies. 3.5 Economics In keeping with the Sustainability principle: The KOB Consortia MUST publish the KOB Economic Policies as a Controlled Document managed as specified by KOBPIU Governing Bodies in conjunction with KOB Foundation legal counsel. The KOB Consortia MUST manage Ledger Fees and any mechanism used for paying them to ensure economic viability and sustainability for KOBPIU Infrastructure in keeping with its charter as a non-profit public trust organization. The KOB Consortia MUST retain a qualified Auditor to publish an annual public audit of KOBPIU Foundation finances. Note: KOB Consortia or KOBPIU Foundation? 4 GOVERNANCE The KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document and the Controlled Documents listed in Appendix A shall be revised from time to time as KOBPIU Infrastructure grows and evolves. The policies in this section govern this process. 4.1 General The KOB Consortia MUST publish KOB Governance Bodies as a Controlled Document managed by the KOB Board of Trustees. KOB Governance Bodies MUST specify the KOB Governing Body for each Controlled Document. All KOBPIU Governance Framework documents, including Controlled Documents, MUST use keywords in policies as defined in IETF RFC 2119 . All KOBPIU Governance Framework documents MAY be revised to add non-normative content, such as references to appendices, white papers, or other explanatory materials, without triggering a formal revision review process as defined in this section 4. 4.2 Revisions to the KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document These policies apply to any normative revision to the present document, exclusive of Appendix A. Revisions to the KOBPIU-GF Master Document MUST respect the Purpose and Core Principles. The commencement of any revision process MUST be publicly announced by the KOB Foundation no later than the time of commencement.

The KOBPIU-GF works as the constitution for the KOBPIU. It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The KOBPIU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the KOBPIU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that consortium members may have as itility participants. The KOBPIU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents shown in blue and yellow in Figure(). The KOB Consortia will also publish additional operational documents, including white papers, FAQs, readiness checklists, design guidelines, sample schemas, etc., as needed. The documents are organized in three categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. The normative documents in the KOBPIU-GF V1 are: KOBPOIU Governance Framework Master Document V1 - The present document. Five legal agreements: KOBPIU Steward Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Stewards who operate Nodes of the KOBPIU. Transaction Author Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Identity Owners writing Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Transaction Endorser Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and Organizations using Permissioned Write Access. Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) V1 \u2014 The agreement under which Stewards serve as data processors from a data protection regulatory standpoint. Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement V1 \u2014 The DPA that applies to Transaction Endorsers. KOBPIU Glossary V1 \u2014 The terminology and definitions that apply to all KOBPIU-GF documents and across KOBPIU infrastructure as a whole. Controlled Documents \u2014 Technical specifications, standards, and policies that are independently maintained and versioned either by the KOB Consortia (e.g., the KOBPIU (TODO:-Change back) DID Method) or external standards bodies (e.g., W3C, OASIS). Another document, the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework , does not directly govern KOBPIU Infrastructure; rather it defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of KOBPIU actors, including the KOB Consortia, to the policies of the KOBPIU-GF.","title":"1.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this DPA will have the meaning given to them in the KSA or in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this DPA and the KSA, this DPA will govern. This DPA will survive termination of the KSA as long as Steward Processes Personal Data. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree as follows: 1. Definitions. \u201cGDPR\u201d means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, and any amendment or replacement to it. \u201cImpermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger and that a Steward Processes that is not Permissible Personal Data in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement. \u201cPermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data expressly listed in Schedule 1 that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement and that a Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means information that relates, directly or indirectly, to a data subject, including without limitation, names, email addresses, postal addresses, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of the data subject. \u201cProcess\u201d or \u201cProcessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Node Data, whether or not by automated means, such as the access, collection, use, storage, disclosure, dissemination, combination, recording, organization, structuring, adaption, alteration, copying, transfer, retrieval, consultation, disposal, restriction, erasure and/or destruction of Node Data. \u201cNode Data\u201d means any information which includes any Personal Data that Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cSecurity Breach\u201d means any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, any Node Data or otherwise affecting Steward\u2019s operation of the Steward Node in compliance with this DPA. \u201cKOBPIU Governance Framework\u201d means the KOB Foundation\u2019s governance policies and rules available here . (check again) \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d means the standard contractual clauses, as agreed by the European Commission, for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection as set out in Commission Decision C(2010) 593, as updated, amended replaced or superseded from time to time by the European Commission. (Check again) \u201cSubprocessor\u201d means any processor engaged by Steward who will access or receive Personal Data from Steward for Processing. The terms \u201ccontroller\u201d, \u201cdata subject\u201d, \u201cpersonal data\u201d, \u201cprocessor\u201d, and \u201csupervisory authority\u201d as used in this DPA will have the meanings ascribed to them in the GDPR. 2. Purpose of Processing Personal Data. In connection with performing its services obligations under the KSA (the \u201cServices\u201d) Steward may Process Node Data in accordance with this DPA. Specific details of the Processing activities including categories and type of Node Data that Steward will Process in connection with the KSA are set forth in Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing). 3. Processor and Controller Responsibilities. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree that the KOB Consortia is the legal entity that serves as the designated data controller for Personal Data written to the KOBPIU Ledger for the purpose of making decisions relating to the architecture, operation and governance of the KOBPIU Network and being the point of contact as explained in Section 3(c) below. Therefore, the parties acknowledge and agree that: (a) Steward is a processor of Node Data under the GDPR and (b) the KOB Consortia is the designated controller of Node Data under the GDPR and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to it as data controller. Transaction Authors are independent controllers of any Personal Data they write to the KOBPIU Ledger. Transaction Authors and the KOB Consortia independently determine the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. In no event will Transaction Authors be deemed joint controllers with the KOB Consortia under Article 26 of the GDPR or deemed to jointly determine and control the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. The KOB Consortia will provide the list of all other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) on behalf of which the Steward Processes Personal Data through the KOBPIU Ledger by referring Stewards to information available on the KOBPIU Ledger. As an accommodation to Steward, the KOB Consortia shall serve as the administrative coordinator for a Transaction Author\u2019s exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under the GDPR by serving as a single point of contact for Steward and by obtaining all necessary permissions from the other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) for the Processing of the Node Data. Steward shall be discharged of its obligation to inform or notify another Controller when it has provided such information or notice required under the GDPR to the KOB Consortia. Similarly, Steward will serve as a single point of contact for KOB Consortia with respect to its obligations as a processor under this DPA.However, in no event will the KOB Consortia be held liable for the actions or omissions of any Transaction Author arising out of any Personal Data that such Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in breach of the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, including but not limited to any Impermissible Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Transaction Author writes Permissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger in express compliance with the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, the KOB Consortia is responsible for the lawfulness of such Processing once such Permissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger. 4. Steward Responsibilities. Steward will: Process Node Data only in accordance with the KOBPIU Governance Framework and other lawful documented instructions (\u201cAdditional Instruction\u201d) from the KOB Consortia. If Steward notifies KOB Consortia that such other instruction is not feasible, the parties shall work together to find an alternative. If neither the Additional Instruction nor an alternative is feasible, the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services pursuant to the KSA. Steward will inform the KOB Consortia if it is aware or reasonably suspects that the KOB Foundation\u2019s instructions regarding the Processing of Node Data may breach the GDPR and may suspend the performance of such instruction until the KOB Consortia has modified the instruction or confirmed its lawfulness in documented form; ensure that persons authorized to Process the Node Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality even if such Node Data is public or already in the possession of Steward; promptly notify and reasonably assist the KOB Consortia, if it receives a request from a data subject for access to, correction, amendment, deletion of or objection to the Processing of Node Data relating to such individual; assist the KOB Consortia, at the KOB Foundation\u2019s request, in complying with the KOB Foundation\u2019s obligations to respond to data subject requests and its compliance regarding Node Data Processed by Steward, to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Steward; at the direction of the KOB Consortia, cooperate and assist the KOB Consortia in conducting a data protection impact assessment and related consultations with any supervisory authority; and comply with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to Steward as a processor in Processing the Node Data and in the performance of the Services. 5. Subprocessors . The KOB Consortia generally authorizes the use of Subprocessors to Process Node Data in connection with fulfilling Steward\u2019s obligations under the KSA and/or this DPA; provided that such Subprocessors meet the requirements set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Steward will remain fully responsible for fulfilment of its obligations under this DPA and will remain the primary point of contact regarding any Processing of Node Data. Steward will be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors and anyone else to which the Processing of Node Data or operation of the Node has been delegated by it. Steward will impose contractual obligations on its Subprocessors that are at least equivalent to those obligations imposed on Steward under this DPA. Upon KOB Foundation\u2019s request, KOB Consortia has the right to review and recommend changes to the relevant subprocessing contract between Steward and its 4 Subprocessors, and Steward will reasonably comply with such request. Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing (email acceptable) of any proposed changes to its Subprocessors and give the KOB Consortia the opportunity to object to such changes. Within thirty (30) days after Steward notifies the KOB Consortia of the intended change, the KOB Consortia can object to the addition of a Subprocessor on the basis that such addition would cause the KOB Consortia to violate the GDPR or other applicable privacy laws. Such objection shall be in writing and include specific reasons for its objection and reasonable options to mitigate, if any. If the KOB Consortia does not object within such period, the respective Subprocessor will be permitted to Process Node Data. If the KOB Consortia objects to the addition of a Subprocessor in accordance with this Section 5 and Steward cannot reasonably accommodate such objection, Steward will promptly notify it in writing stating in reasonable detail the reason for such inability to accommodate such objection. In such event, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to find a feasible workaround; provided that, if the parties are unable to find a feasible workaround within thirty (30) days of Steward\u2019s notice, then the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services as set out in the KSA without any liability to Steward. 6. Data Transfers . For all Stewards not based in the European Economic Area (EEA) (check again) , by signing this DPA, each party is deemed to have signed the Standard Contractual Clauses, attached hereto as Schedule 2, with the KOB Consortia, on its own and on behalf of the respective Transaction Authors, as the \u201cData Exporter\u201d and Steward as the \u201cData Importer\u201d (as each of these terms is defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). If a Subprocessor of Steward is a Data Importer, Steward agrees that it will enter into the EU controller to non-EU or EEA processor Standard Contractual Clauses on behalf of such Subprocessor if it is an affiliate of Steward, otherwise Steward will enter into a written agreement imposing obligations on such Subprocessor at least as stringent as those imposed on Steward in accordance with Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. 7. Security Safeguards . Steward will implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive written information security policy that contains appropriate technical and organizational measures (the \u201cSteward TOMs\u201d) to protect the security and confidentiality of Node Data. The Steward TOMs will be appropriate to the Node Data that Steward Processes and will meet the requirements set forth in Article 32 of the GDPR, the KSA and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. The Steward TOMs will meet the standards in Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto and the Steward Technical and Organizational Policies as set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework (the \u201cSteward TOPs\u201d). The parties agree the Steward TOPS satisfy the requirements of this Section 7. The KOB Consortia may update the Steward TOPs pursuant to the KOBPIU Governance Framework in light of the development and progression of technology. Such updates will be communicated to Steward via electronic communication and/or notification on the KOB Consortia website. Accordingly, Steward reserves the right to implement Steward TOMs that exceed the requirements of the Steward TOPs; provided that the functionality and security of the Services are not degraded. 8. Audits . Upon reasonable notice to Steward, the KOB Consortia may conduct or may engage an independent third party which shall not be a direct competitor of Steward and shall be bound to obligations of confidentiality (\u201cAuditor\u201d) to conduct an information security audit of Steward to meet its audit requirements under Article 28 of the GDPR and its obligations under Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. Prior to commencement of the audit, the parties will agree in writing to the terms and conditions governing the conduct of the audit. Steward will reasonably cooperate with the KOB Consortia and/or its Auditor in conducting such audit; provided that, nothing in this DPA will require Steward to provide information to the KOB Consortia that is publicly available on the KOBPIU Ledger. KOB Consortia agrees to reimburse reasonable and documented expenses incurred by Steward related to any information security audit initiated by KOB Consortia. 9. Security Breach . Without undue delay after becoming aware, Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing of any actual Security Breach. Steward will promptly investigate any Security Breach and is obligated to expend no more than an amount mutually agreed between KOB Consortia and Steward. Any additional amount of required expenditure will be the obligation of KOB Consortia consistent with Section 13 below. Steward will provide the KOB Consortia with reasonable assistance to satisfy any legal obligations of the KOB Consortia in relation to such Security Breach (including any obligation to notify data protection authorities or data subjects). In the event of a Security Breach, the KOB Consortia has the right to control the breach notification process, unless the GDPR dictates otherwise. 10. Return or Destruction of Node Data . Upon termination or expiration of the KSA and to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network, Steward will return to the KOB Consortia or destroy all Node Data and all copies thereof in its possession or under its control as specified in the Steward TOPs, except to the extent that Steward is required under the GDPR to keep a copy of the Node Data. 11. Records . In addition to the record provided by the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward will keep at its normal place of business all information relating to Steward\u2019s Processing of Node Data as described in the Steward TOPs and in this DPA pursuant to Article 28(h) of the GDPR. Steward will make such documents and all other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations in Article 28(h) of the GDPR available to the KOB Consortia upon request. 12. Limitation of Liability . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the KSA, a party\u2019s liability for breach of its obligations including any claims arising from this DPA or the Standard Contractual Clauses, will be limited as set forth below. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS DPA,INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA EXCEED $250,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA SHALL NOT EXCEED $500,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, THERE SHALL BE NO DOLLAR CAP ON SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA. (Check the figures again) However, in the event of any conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and this Section 12, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail but only with respect to claims arising from the Standard Contractual Clauses. As the KOB Consortia is entering into this DPA on behalf of itself and the Transaction Authors, the KOB Consortia will secure a Transaction Author\u2019s consent to the limitation of liability set forth in this Section 12 through the Transaction Author Agreement. Therefore a Transaction Author will be considered a \u201cparty\u201d as used in this Section 12 for the purpose of interpreting this limitation of liability. Without prejudice to Art. 82 of GDPR and for the avoidance of doubt, no controller will be jointly and severally liable with any other controller to Steward or vice versa. 13. Assistance : The KOB Consortia will make a written request to Steward for any assistance referred to in this DPA. Steward and the KOB Consortia will mutually agree in writing to a reasonable charge for Steward to perform such assistance or an Additional Instruction. If the parties do not mutually agree to such reasonable charge, the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to find a feasible solution. 14. Disputes . The parties will make good faith efforts to first resolve internally any dispute under this DPA. Neither party will seek any external remedies until thirty (30) days have elapsed from the initiation of such good faith efforts. At the conclusion of any such thirty (30) day period, each party shall be entitled as a matter of right to seek remedies for any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, relating to, involving, or having any connection with this DPA, including any question regarding the validity, interpretation, scope, performance, or enforceability of this dispute resolution provision, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in equity or otherwise. The rights conferred upon the parties by the preceding sentence shall not be exclusive of any other rights or remedies which each party may have at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties hereto have caused this DPA to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.

(the data exporter) And The Steward named in the KSA (the data importer) each a \u201cparty\u201d; together \u201cthe parties\u201d, HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1. TODO: Clause 1 Page:10 Clause 2 Details of the transfer The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses. Clause 3 Third-party beneficiary clause The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. Clause 4 Obligations of the data exporter The data exporter agrees and warrants: that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State; that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract; that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation; that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC (check again) ; to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i). Clause 5 Obligations of the data importer The data importer agrees and warrants: to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred; that it will promptly notify the data exporter about: any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, any accidental or unauthorised access, and any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so; to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred; at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority; to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter; that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent; that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the date exporter. Clause 6 Liability The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. Clause 7 Mediation and jurisdiction The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority; to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. Clause 8 Cooperation with supervisory authorities The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). Clause 9 Governing Law The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. Clause 10 Variation of the contract The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause. Clause 11 Sub-processing The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses( ). Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations 3 under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority. Clause 12 Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this DPA will have the meaning given to them in the KSA or in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this DPA and the KSA, this DPA will govern. This DPA will survive termination of the KSA as long as Steward Processes Personal Data. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree as follows: 1. Definitions. \u201cGDPR\u201d means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, and any amendment or replacement to it. \u201cImpermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger and that a Steward Processes that is not Permissible Personal Data in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement. \u201cPermissible Personal Data\u201d means the Personal Data expressly listed in Schedule 1 that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement and that a Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means information that relates, directly or indirectly, to a data subject, including without limitation, names, email addresses, postal addresses, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of the data subject. \u201cProcess\u201d or \u201cProcessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Node Data, whether or not by automated means, such as the access, collection, use, storage, disclosure, dissemination, combination, recording, organization, structuring, adaption, alteration, copying, transfer, retrieval, consultation, disposal, restriction, erasure and/or destruction of Node Data. \u201cNode Data\u201d means any information which includes any Personal Data that Steward Processes through the Steward Node. \u201cSecurity Breach\u201d means any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, any Node Data or otherwise affecting Steward\u2019s operation of the Steward Node in compliance with this DPA. \u201cKOBPIU Governance Framework\u201d means the KOB Foundation\u2019s governance policies and rules available here . (check again) \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d means the standard contractual clauses, as agreed by the European Commission, for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection as set out in Commission Decision C(2010) 593, as updated, amended replaced or superseded from time to time by the European Commission. (Check again) \u201cSubprocessor\u201d means any processor engaged by Steward who will access or receive Personal Data from Steward for Processing. The terms \u201ccontroller\u201d, \u201cdata subject\u201d, \u201cpersonal data\u201d, \u201cprocessor\u201d, and \u201csupervisory authority\u201d as used in this DPA will have the meanings ascribed to them in the GDPR. 2. Purpose of Processing Personal Data. In connection with performing its services obligations under the KSA (the \u201cServices\u201d) Steward may Process Node Data in accordance with this DPA. Specific details of the Processing activities including categories and type of Node Data that Steward will Process in connection with the KSA are set forth in Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing). 3. Processor and Controller Responsibilities. The KOB Consortia and Steward agree that the KOB Consortia is the legal entity that serves as the designated data controller for Personal Data written to the KOBPIU Ledger for the purpose of making decisions relating to the architecture, operation and governance of the KOBPIU Network and being the point of contact as explained in Section 3(c) below. Therefore, the parties acknowledge and agree that: (a) Steward is a processor of Node Data under the GDPR and (b) the KOB Consortia is the designated controller of Node Data under the GDPR and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to it as data controller. Transaction Authors are independent controllers of any Personal Data they write to the KOBPIU Ledger. Transaction Authors and the KOB Consortia independently determine the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. In no event will Transaction Authors be deemed joint controllers with the KOB Consortia under Article 26 of the GDPR or deemed to jointly determine and control the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. The KOB Consortia will provide the list of all other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) on behalf of which the Steward Processes Personal Data through the KOBPIU Ledger by referring Stewards to information available on the KOBPIU Ledger. As an accommodation to Steward, the KOB Consortia shall serve as the administrative coordinator for a Transaction Author\u2019s exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under the GDPR by serving as a single point of contact for Steward and by obtaining all necessary permissions from the other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) for the Processing of the Node Data. Steward shall be discharged of its obligation to inform or notify another Controller when it has provided such information or notice required under the GDPR to the KOB Consortia. Similarly, Steward will serve as a single point of contact for KOB Consortia with respect to its obligations as a processor under this DPA.However, in no event will the KOB Consortia be held liable for the actions or omissions of any Transaction Author arising out of any Personal Data that such Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in breach of the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, including but not limited to any Impermissible Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Transaction Author writes Permissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger in express compliance with the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, the KOB Consortia is responsible for the lawfulness of such Processing once such Permissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger. 4. Steward Responsibilities. Steward will: Process Node Data only in accordance with the KOBPIU Governance Framework and other lawful documented instructions (\u201cAdditional Instruction\u201d) from the KOB Consortia. If Steward notifies KOB Consortia that such other instruction is not feasible, the parties shall work together to find an alternative. If neither the Additional Instruction nor an alternative is feasible, the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services pursuant to the KSA. Steward will inform the KOB Consortia if it is aware or reasonably suspects that the KOB Foundation\u2019s instructions regarding the Processing of Node Data may breach the GDPR and may suspend the performance of such instruction until the KOB Consortia has modified the instruction or confirmed its lawfulness in documented form; ensure that persons authorized to Process the Node Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality even if such Node Data is public or already in the possession of Steward; promptly notify and reasonably assist the KOB Consortia, if it receives a request from a data subject for access to, correction, amendment, deletion of or objection to the Processing of Node Data relating to such individual; assist the KOB Consortia, at the KOB Foundation\u2019s request, in complying with the KOB Foundation\u2019s obligations to respond to data subject requests and its compliance regarding Node Data Processed by Steward, to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Steward; at the direction of the KOB Consortia, cooperate and assist the KOB Consortia in conducting a data protection impact assessment and related consultations with any supervisory authority; and comply with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to Steward as a processor in Processing the Node Data and in the performance of the Services. 5. Subprocessors . The KOB Consortia generally authorizes the use of Subprocessors to Process Node Data in connection with fulfilling Steward\u2019s obligations under the KSA and/or this DPA; provided that such Subprocessors meet the requirements set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Steward will remain fully responsible for fulfilment of its obligations under this DPA and will remain the primary point of contact regarding any Processing of Node Data. Steward will be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors and anyone else to which the Processing of Node Data or operation of the Node has been delegated by it. Steward will impose contractual obligations on its Subprocessors that are at least equivalent to those obligations imposed on Steward under this DPA. Upon KOB Foundation\u2019s request, KOB Consortia has the right to review and recommend changes to the relevant subprocessing contract between Steward and its 4 Subprocessors, and Steward will reasonably comply with such request. Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing (email acceptable) of any proposed changes to its Subprocessors and give the KOB Consortia the opportunity to object to such changes. Within thirty (30) days after Steward notifies the KOB Consortia of the intended change, the KOB Consortia can object to the addition of a Subprocessor on the basis that such addition would cause the KOB Consortia to violate the GDPR or other applicable privacy laws. Such objection shall be in writing and include specific reasons for its objection and reasonable options to mitigate, if any. If the KOB Consortia does not object within such period, the respective Subprocessor will be permitted to Process Node Data. If the KOB Consortia objects to the addition of a Subprocessor in accordance with this Section 5 and Steward cannot reasonably accommodate such objection, Steward will promptly notify it in writing stating in reasonable detail the reason for such inability to accommodate such objection. In such event, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to find a feasible workaround; provided that, if the parties are unable to find a feasible workaround within thirty (30) days of Steward\u2019s notice, then the KOB Consortia may terminate the affected Services as set out in the KSA without any liability to Steward. 6. Data Transfers . For all Stewards not based in the European Economic Area (EEA) (check again) , by signing this DPA, each party is deemed to have signed the Standard Contractual Clauses, attached hereto as Schedule 2, with the KOB Consortia, on its own and on behalf of the respective Transaction Authors, as the \u201cData Exporter\u201d and Steward as the \u201cData Importer\u201d (as each of these terms is defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). If a Subprocessor of Steward is a Data Importer, Steward agrees that it will enter into the EU controller to non-EU or EEA processor Standard Contractual Clauses on behalf of such Subprocessor if it is an affiliate of Steward, otherwise Steward will enter into a written agreement imposing obligations on such Subprocessor at least as stringent as those imposed on Steward in accordance with Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. 7. Security Safeguards . Steward will implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive written information security policy that contains appropriate technical and organizational measures (the \u201cSteward TOMs\u201d) to protect the security and confidentiality of Node Data. The Steward TOMs will be appropriate to the Node Data that Steward Processes and will meet the requirements set forth in Article 32 of the GDPR, the KSA and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. The Steward TOMs will meet the standards in Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto and the Steward Technical and Organizational Policies as set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework (the \u201cSteward TOPs\u201d). The parties agree the Steward TOPS satisfy the requirements of this Section 7. The KOB Consortia may update the Steward TOPs pursuant to the KOBPIU Governance Framework in light of the development and progression of technology. Such updates will be communicated to Steward via electronic communication and/or notification on the KOB Consortia website. Accordingly, Steward reserves the right to implement Steward TOMs that exceed the requirements of the Steward TOPs; provided that the functionality and security of the Services are not degraded. 8. Audits . Upon reasonable notice to Steward, the KOB Consortia may conduct or may engage an independent third party which shall not be a direct competitor of Steward and shall be bound to obligations of confidentiality (\u201cAuditor\u201d) to conduct an information security audit of Steward to meet its audit requirements under Article 28 of the GDPR and its obligations under Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. Prior to commencement of the audit, the parties will agree in writing to the terms and conditions governing the conduct of the audit. Steward will reasonably cooperate with the KOB Consortia and/or its Auditor in conducting such audit; provided that, nothing in this DPA will require Steward to provide information to the KOB Consortia that is publicly available on the KOBPIU Ledger. KOB Consortia agrees to reimburse reasonable and documented expenses incurred by Steward related to any information security audit initiated by KOB Consortia. 9. Security Breach . Without undue delay after becoming aware, Steward will notify the KOB Consortia in writing of any actual Security Breach. Steward will promptly investigate any Security Breach and is obligated to expend no more than an amount mutually agreed between KOB Consortia and Steward. Any additional amount of required expenditure will be the obligation of KOB Consortia consistent with Section 13 below. Steward will provide the KOB Consortia with reasonable assistance to satisfy any legal obligations of the KOB Consortia in relation to such Security Breach (including any obligation to notify data protection authorities or data subjects). In the event of a Security Breach, the KOB Consortia has the right to control the breach notification process, unless the GDPR dictates otherwise. 10. Return or Destruction of Node Data . Upon termination or expiration of the KSA and to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network, Steward will return to the KOB Consortia or destroy all Node Data and all copies thereof in its possession or under its control as specified in the Steward TOPs, except to the extent that Steward is required under the GDPR to keep a copy of the Node Data. 11. Records . In addition to the record provided by the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward will keep at its normal place of business all information relating to Steward\u2019s Processing of Node Data as described in the Steward TOPs and in this DPA pursuant to Article 28(h) of the GDPR. Steward will make such documents and all other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations in Article 28(h) of the GDPR available to the KOB Consortia upon request. 12. Limitation of Liability . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the KSA, a party\u2019s liability for breach of its obligations including any claims arising from this DPA or the Standard Contractual Clauses, will be limited as set forth below. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS DPA,INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA EXCEED $250,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA SHALL NOT EXCEED $500,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, THERE SHALL BE NO DOLLAR CAP ON SUCH PARTY\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA. (Check the figures again) However, in the event of any conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and this Section 12, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail but only with respect to claims arising from the Standard Contractual Clauses. As the KOB Consortia is entering into this DPA on behalf of itself and the Transaction Authors, the KOB Consortia will secure a Transaction Author\u2019s consent to the limitation of liability set forth in this Section 12 through the Transaction Author Agreement. Therefore a Transaction Author will be considered a \u201cparty\u201d as used in this Section 12 for the purpose of interpreting this limitation of liability. Without prejudice to Art. 82 of GDPR and for the avoidance of doubt, no controller will be jointly and severally liable with any other controller to Steward or vice versa. 13. Assistance : The KOB Consortia will make a written request to Steward for any assistance referred to in this DPA. Steward and the KOB Consortia will mutually agree in writing to a reasonable charge for Steward to perform such assistance or an Additional Instruction. If the parties do not mutually agree to such reasonable charge, the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to find a feasible solution. 14. Disputes . The parties will make good faith efforts to first resolve internally any dispute under this DPA. Neither party will seek any external remedies until thirty (30) days have elapsed from the initiation of such good faith efforts. At the conclusion of any such thirty (30) day period, each party shall be entitled as a matter of right to seek remedies for any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, relating to, involving, or having any connection with this DPA, including any question regarding the validity, interpretation, scope, performance, or enforceability of this dispute resolution provision, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in equity or otherwise. The rights conferred upon the parties by the preceding sentence shall not be exclusive of any other rights or remedies which each party may have at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties hereto have caused this DPA to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.

Duration of Processing : The Processing will begin on the effective date of the KSA and will continue through the period from expiration of the KSA until deletion of all Node Data by Steward in accordance with this DPA. Nature and Purpose of Processing : Steward will Process Node Data solely as necessary to operate, maintain and host a Node in accordance with the KSA and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Types of Personal Data : Permissible Personal Data : Public DIDs, public keys, and any other Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement. Impermissible Personal Data : The KOBPIU Governance Framework prohibits writing of Impermissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger. If Impermissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward has no obligation or liability with respect to such Impermissible Personal Data, except to promptly notify the KOB Consortia in writing. Categories of Data Subjects : Node Data may belong to any of the following categories of data subjects: Transaction Authors who are natural persons Order of precedence The KOB Consortia may update the content of this Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing), including the types of Permissible Personal Data and Impermissible Personal Data, from time to time by updating the KOBPIU Governance Framework. Solely with reference to the details of the Processing of the Node Data included in this Schedule 1, in case of conflict, the KOBPIU Governance Framework will prevail over the present Schedule 1. TODO: Check the entire schedule 2 again Schedule 2 - Standarad Contractual Clauses Commission Decision C (2010)593 For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection Name of the data exporting organisation: The KOB Consortia, on its own behalf and on behalf of applicable Transaction Authors who may act as independent controllers for purposes of these clauses. (the data exporter) And The Steward named in the KSA (the data importer) each a \u201cparty\u201d; together \u201cthe parties\u201d, HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1. TODO: Clause 1 Page:10 Clause 2 Details of the transfer The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.

The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. Clause 4 Obligations of the data exporter The data exporter agrees and warrants: that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State; that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract; that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation; that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC (check again) ; to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i). Clause 5 Obligations of the data importer The data importer agrees and warrants: to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred; that it will promptly notify the data exporter about: any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, any accidental or unauthorised access, and any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so; to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred; at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority; to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter; that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent; that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the date exporter. Clause 6 Liability The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. Clause 7 Mediation and jurisdiction The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority; to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. Clause 8 Cooperation with supervisory authorities The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). Clause 9 Governing Law The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. Clause 10 Variation of the contract The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause. Clause 11 Sub-processing The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses( ). Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations 3 under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority. Clause 12 Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

The KOBPIU Governance Framework and KOBPIU Glossary (Add link to glossary) is incorporated into this Agreement by reference only for purposes of use of such defined terms. 2)Permission to Write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks The KOB Consortia hereby grants to Transaction Author a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty free, revocable license to write to and use the KOBPIU Ledger Networks in accordance with this Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. When authoring Transactions under the policy of Permissioned Write Access, a Transaction Author may only write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by using an authorized Transaction Endorser. In the event that KOB Consortia enables Public Write Access to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks, the Transaction Author will not need a Transaction Endorser to endorse a Transaction. Once an initial Transaction has been written to one of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by the Transaction Author (\u201cInitial Transaction\u201d), the Transaction Author is granted permission to make additional Transactions to update the state of a previous Transaction (\u201cUpdate Transactions\u201d). Please note, an Update Transaction does not remove the Initial Transaction, which will remain on the KOBPIU Ledger due to its immutability and may remain on KOBPIU Test Networks unless they are reset. Transaction Author may make Update Transactions if and only if the Transaction Author was the author of the Initial Transaction. Update Transactions are Transactions and are subject to all the terms of this Agreement. 3) Transaction Author Obligations With regard to all Transactions, Transaction Author will: comply with any requirements imposed by the Transaction Endorser on the Transaction Author and any Transactions endorsed by the Transaction Endorser; not write Transactions containing Personal Data until KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transactions to contain Personal Data pursuant to Section 3(b) below. If the KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transaction Authors to write Transactions that contain Permissible Personal Data (\u201cPersonal Data Transactions\u201d), then Transaction Author expressly agrees that: It will not write any Transactions that contain Impermissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks; it is an independent data controller (as defined in the GDPR) of the Personal Data Transactions and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the Data Protection Laws; it acknowledges and will notify all data subjects whose Personal Data it Processes that functions inherent in blockchain technology may render fulfilling data subject requests difficult or impossible. For example, due to blockchain\u2019s immutability, data stored on a blockchain generally cannot be removed or altered once the data is confirmed on the blockchain; it irrevocably waives any and all claims, rights and/or obligations it may have now or in the future against the KOB Consortia as a result of being unable to fulfill data subject requests in accordance with Data Protection Laws; it agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to Transaction Author as a controller of Personal Data Transactions under the Data Processing Agreements with Stewards and Transaction Endorsers, each in their roles as processors under the GDPR, and attached as Appendices A and B (the \u201cDPAs\u201d); that the KOB Consortia has the right to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and the DPAs are made a part of the Agreement in their entirety; by signing this Agreement, each Party is deemed to have signed the DPAs, including the Standard Contractual Clauses with the KOB Consortia and Transaction Author as the \u201cData exporter,\u201d and with either a Steward or a Transaction Endorser as \u201cData importer,\u201d as applicable; at the KOB Consortia\u2019s request, the Transaction Author will reimburse the KOB Consortia for any costs incurred by the KOB Consortia in enforcing the Transaction Author\u2019s rights under the GDPR, including but not limited to fulfillment of data subject rights, rights of oversight and audit, etc.; and it irrevocably waives any and all claims that it may have now or in the future that the KOB Consortia lacks the rights to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and bind Transaction Author to the DPAs\u2019 terms and conditions, including the limitation of liability therein. 4) Term and Termination This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in force until terminated by either Party pursuant to this Section 4 (Term and Termination). Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (i) if the other Party has materially defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement and has not cured such default within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of written notice from the non-defaulting Party of such default or (ii) immediately in the event of any government sanctions or other legal measures that make it unlawful for Transaction Author to write Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Additionally, Transaction Author may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days\u2019 advance written notice to the KOB Consortia and ceasing all use of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason the rights granted to Transaction Author by the KOB Consortia under this Agreement automatically terminate. 5) Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer By KOB Consortia.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Transaction Endorser endorses Permissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks in express compliance with this Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, KOB Consortia is responsible for the lawfulness of such Processing once such Permissible Personal Data is endorsed to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks.

Transaction Endorser agrees to promptly notify the KOBPIU Parties in writing of any Claims, cooperate with the KOBPIU Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys\u2019 fees).

Arbitration proceedings will be held in London, England. Unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree, such arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by electronic exchange of documents and by video conference.

The arbitrator shall require exchange by the Parties of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim, defense, or counterclaim or on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim, defense, or counterclaim, with due regard for eliminating undue burden and expense and the expedited and lower cost nature of arbitration. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator may at his or her discretion order the deposition of witnesses. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three depositions per Party, each of a maximum of four hours duration, unless the arbitrator otherwise determines.

Each Party hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication of any such equitable or injunctive relief, as well as for any such matters that are excluded from or fall outside of this arbitration provision. 8) Limitation of Liability EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.
