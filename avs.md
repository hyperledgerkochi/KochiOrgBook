## KOB Address Verification Service
- A user uses this service to get a digital domicile credential which proves
their domicile.
- Credential represents certificates given to people by an issuing authority
like Driverâ€™s license issued by RTO, Degree Qualification certificates by
Universities etc.
- These credentials are verifiable and are digital equivalents to paper
credentials that are cryptographically processed.
- It is useful in a situation when the user has to prove his/her domicile for
some needs.
- The credentials thus obtained can be stored in the user's wallet application
and the user will have complete control over the credentials.
- Wallet, here, is an android application which acts as a datastore to store identity data on a cloud.
